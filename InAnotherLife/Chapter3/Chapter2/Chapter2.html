  <div id="Three" class="poem-header">Au Revoir</div>
  <div class="textual-content poem-content">
    Waking up into a dream <br>
    with a muffled groan, a stifled scream. <br>
    Reality splitting at its seams. <br>
    Suspended in a world of make-believe. <br>
    Where silences echo, shadows bleed, <br>
    and the weight of emptiness crushes everything underneath. <br>
    The memories flood in. I'll drown if I breathe. <br>

    <br>

    These moments, they are far and few. <br>
    But today, it's not even dawn yet, <br>
    and I'm already thinking of you. <br>

    <br>

    I've walked down this memory lane. <br>
    Seen all the attractions, <br>
    peered through all the window panes. <br>
    Know all the shortcuts by heart, <br>
    know which streets to avoid when it gets dark. <br>
    Been lost here one too many times. <br>
    No GPS, street signs, or warning lights. <br>
    The only way out then, is through carefully crafted lies. <br>

    <br>

    Bounded by space. Thwarted by time. <br>
    Or maybe something divine. <br>
    Two waves out of phase. <br>
    Queen of fire. King of ashes. <br>
    The memories are stitched into my soul. <br>
    How do I let them go without ripping myself in twos? <br>

    <br>

    Why'd you tear down, this pedestal I placed you on? <br>
    Why'd you laugh, when I said you could do no wrong? <br>
    A wish turned true, then why didn't you believe in shooting stars? <br>
    Carved out of marble, then why'd you say you too have scars? <br>
    This edifice I built for you, why'd you call it a facade? <br>
    Why'd you say you're no God? <br>

    <br>

    I would walk the earth to get to you, <br>
    but those last two feet of distance, <br>
    that would take another life to close. <br>
    I know there is a world where we will meet again. <br>
    Where you will be the you-est you, I will be the me-est me, <br>
    After-life, re-birth, or whatever the Gods' decree. <br>
    And it's only now I see <br>
    why inventing religion was man's necessity. <br>

    <br>

    With this, for now, I say goodbye. <br>
    Until we meet again. <br>
    Au Revoir. <br>
  </div>

  <div id="Two" class="poem-header">The Trichotomy of Time</div>
  <div class="textual-content poem-content">
    Now it's your choice, you decide <br>
    All of it, an outcome of your own design <br>
    What you wanted, now before your own eyes <br>
    Your third and final wish, now brought to life. <br>
    Then what's this emptiness inside <br>
    It feels like something's still not right <br>
    What's your response - fight or flight? <br>

    <br>

    "no take-backsies" the genie had said, <br>
    and now what you see, fills you with looming dread. <br>
    Is this what they meant when they said - <br>
    You'll anyways grow into an old man filled with regret. <br>
    So daydream a future that won't come to exist, <br>
    however many times you ask yourself "but what if?" <br>

    <br>

    Now watch the clock, as I turn back the time. <br>
    See the hour hand go from eleven, to ten, to nine. <br>
    Seasons from winter to fall to summer to spring - they flash by, <br>
    like two trains moving on parallel tracks on opposite sides. <br>

    <br>

    And now you're at the crossroads where it all began. <br>
    You see your younger self, unsure to go this way or that. <br>
    With these unknowns inside. Thoughts that won't coincide. <br>
    Making a decision devoid of reason. Like writing a song without rhyme. <br>
    Do you interject, or do you let it slide? <br>
    Would you've really been happier if you'd just gone to the other side? <br>

    <br>

    And now you see the picture in its entirety, <br>
    your vision, limit x tends to infinity. <br>
    Some things they were, are, and will be, <br>
    just as they were always meant to be. <br>
    Maybe this is the closest you'll ever come <br>
    to understanding the meaning of the word "destiny". <br>
  </div>


  <div id="One" class="poem-header">The Travelling Salesman's Problem</div>

  <div class="textual-content poem-content">
    Hollow words, plastered smiles <br>
    The truth is left unsaid. You were meant to read between the lines. <br>
    The pauses, they say more, than the words between them. <br>
    A world held together by a string of honest lies. <br>
    <br>

    So keep up the charade, hide behind the facade. <br>
    Which mask shall you wear today? Which role will you play? <br>
    <br>

    A dance of deception. <br>
    <br>

    Where do you go from here? <br>
    The audience changes, the act remains the same. <br>
    <br>

    Show's open. Come on in. <br>
    Now Showing: Someone Trying To Fit In. <br>
    <br>

    Ticket for one, please! <br>
    Now entertain me, monkey. Make it worth my time <br>
    And I will pay you in affection. Or maybe even a repeat visitation. <br>
    But perform something new then, because I'd have already seen this. <br>
    <br>

    A transaction of emotions. <br>
    <br>

    So step out of the wings, take center-stage. <br>
    It's your obligation to shine, brighter than the blinding spotlight. <br>
    <br>

    You contort, distort, twist, turn, and burn <br>
    Without a hint of selfish concern <br>
    Give away everything you've got, turn yourself inside-out <br>
    Keep up the show, through pain and pleasure, moments that could have been leisure <br>
    You end with a crash, a fitting crescendo <br>
    Out of breath, sweaty. Your sides in stitches, every fiber on fire. <br>
    <br>

    The lights turn on. <br>
    You wait for the applause. But there is none. <br>
    You look up. The theatre is empty. <br>
    You were performing for yourself. <br>
    Tell me, then, did you atleast have fun? <br>
