    <div class="sub-heading">Why study about the human brain?</div>
    <div>
      - Brain vs Mind. Brain refers to the physical thing that you can touch. Mind refers to the abstract thing that the brain "contains". <br>
      - By understanding how the brain works, can we answer questions like: are there things that we might not be able to think? Possible true scientific theories that we might not
      be able to understand, ever? <br>
      - Can the change in the structure of the brain change the structure of thought? <br>
      - Advance AI. For instance, visual object recognition was considered a very difficult problem, until this paper was published: <a
      href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a> in 2012.
      By creating AI that can mimic human behavior, we can get a closer insight into how our own brains work, which in turn helps the development of even better AI and turns into a
      nice feedback loop. Both humans and deep nets are pretty good at pattern recognition. What humans are good at, but machines are not, is <i>building models to understand our
      world</i>. Well not all humans, I guess. <br>
      - And because "it is the greatest intellectual quest of all time". Besides, "reverse-engineer the human brain" sounds metal af.

             class="center-block img-fluid" alt="Thread_States" width="550">
      </div>
      <p class="inline-heading">We want to answer questions like: </p> <br>
      - What (if any) is special about the human brain? How do we get to think about these things, and other species don't? <br>
      - Where does knowledge come from? We know all this "stuff". How much of this stuff was wired into our brains (as a result of genetics), and how much of it did we get from
      experience? <br>
      - Can we change the structure of the brain just by learning? <br>
      - Can we think without language? <br>
      - How much of our mind is subconscious? What goes on in the background when we are not paying attention? <br>
      - No one has a freaking clue about how we can get a bunch of neurons to understand the meaning of a particular sentence currently. <br>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Themes of this course</div>
    <div>
      - The brain is not an amorphous mush. It has organization and structure, where the different bits do different things. <br>
      - Some parts of the brain do <i>very</i> specific things. Why do these things only get their dedicated parts, why don't others? Is it because the things that this part does
      are very frequent, or is it that they are too involved? <br>
      - The organization of the brain mirrors the architecture of the mind. So the idea is that if we can explain the fundamental pieces of the brain, then that should help us
      explain the fundamental pieces of the mind. <br>
      - How do brains change? Specifically, how do they change as we age? How do they change as we learn and experience new things? And how do they change if the brain suffers an
      injury? <br>
      - So how will we go about studying the brain? We start by asking the question: "How does the brain give rise to the mind?". To answer this question we need to understand
      what the mind is capable of. The mind can perform various functions like: perception, vision, cognition, hearing, language. For each of these functions, we want to find out
      how this particular function is implemented in the brain. We will focus on the brain functions whose brain basis are best understood - in other words, concentrate on
      functions about which we know the exact parts of the brain that are handling them. For example, about a third of the brain handles vision. So understanding vision will help
      us understand how a major part of the brain works. <br>
      - For each of these functions we will ask the following questions: <br>
      a) To what extent is this process implemented in its own specialized brain hardware? <br>
      b) Do multiple brain regions contribute to this process? <br>
      c) If yes, then is there a division of labor between these regions? <br>
      d) How does this region/system develop? <br>
      e) Does this region have homologues in other species, or is it uniquely human? <br>
      - Note that memory is not being covered in this lecture. Refer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fbrl6WoIyo&list=PL44ABC9278E2EE706">9.00</a> and 9.01 to understand
      these. <br>
      - How are neurons wired together that help us create a picture in the brain from the actual object? <a

    <div>
      - Contains around 10^11 neurons. <br>
      - A neuron looks like this. A neuron looks like any other cell. It's got a nucleus, a cell body. The thing that makes it distinct is that it's got a long cable known as an
      axon. Many neurons have a myelin sheath, a layer of rolled-up fat around the axon, that makes the axon conduct neural signals faster. <br>

      - The brain needs around 20 watts to function, compared to IBM Watson that needs around 20,000 watts. So it's not just about how much stuff the brain can do, but also about
      how efficiently it can do it.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Brain Components: Intro</div>
    <div>
      - There are four main components of the brain: <br>
      a) Brain stem and cerebellum <br>
      b) Limbic system (subcortical regions) <br>
      c) White matter <br>
      d) Cerebral Cortex <br>

      </div>

      - In this course, we will be primarily studying the Cerebral Cortex section of the brain. <br>
      - Your cerebral cortex is the outermost layer of your brain. Its surface has many folds, giving it a wrinkled appearance. The folds consist of many deep grooves called sulci
      and raised areas called gyri. These folds add to the surface area of your cerebral cortex. It's two millimeters (mm) to four mm (0.08 inches to 0.16 inches) thick. Your
      cortex is divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital. Each of these lobes is responsible for processing different types of information. Collectively,
      your cerebral cortex is responsible for the higher-level processes of the human brain, including language, memory, reasoning, thought, learning, decision-making, emotion,
      intelligence and personality.

    <div class="sub-heading">Brain Components: Brain stem and Cerebellum</div>
    <div>
      - Brain stem connects the spinal cord and the cerebellum. Acts like a relay by sending signals from the spinal cord to the cerebellum. It's the most "primitive" part of our
      brain, in that it is shared by beings far higher in our genealogy tree. It's essential to life. You can get by with a large chunk of your cortex missing, but the brain stem
      controls a lot of your basic body functions like breathing, consciousness, body temperature regulation etc. <br>
      - The cerebellum is involved in motor coordination. But it's believed currently that it does not have much role to play in cognition itself. Although you can see some
      activations in the cerebellum when doing brain imagery when testing a lot of activities like perception and language-understanding.

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Brain Components: Limbic system (subcortical regions)</div>
    <div>
      - There are three main parts of the subcortical region: <br>
      a) Thalamus: <br>
      - The thalamus acts like a grand-central for the brain. There are connections going out to all the different parts of the brain from here. One of the key things about the
      thalamus is that all the sensory information coming in first goes into the thalamus, and only then is it sent to the different parts of the cortex (except the olfactory
      sense which directly goes into the cortex). For instance, coming up from the eyes, the axons make a synapse in the thalamus (known as <a
      href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/courses/perception/lecturenotes/V1/lgn-V1.html">LGN Lateral geniculate nucleus</a>) from where they are sent to the visual cortex. <br>
      - But this view of the thalamus acting just as a relay station for synapses is not entirely complete. Why have a synapse instead of just sending the axons directly to the
      responsible parts of the cortex? Also, if you look at the LGN, there are about 10 times as many connections that go <i>back</i> from the primary
      visual cortex to the thalamus, than what go from the thalamus to the visual cortex. Information comes from the eyes, and should go up to the brain. Why the need for 10X
      connections to come back from the cortex to the thalamus? We do not know. <br>
      - In some work done in mice, it has been shown that thalamus essentially acts like a gate by blocking and allowing sensory input from one part of the cortex to another when
      switching tasks.

        </div>
      </div>

      b) Hippocampus: <br>
      - This deals with long-term episodic memory and also plays a key role in navigation. <br>
      - One of the key cases that helped in the understanding of the functions of the Hippocampus is that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison">HM who had
      surgery to remove his hippocampus</a> on both sides, and as a result completely lost his ability to form episodic memories for anything that happened after the surgery. He
      developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia">Anterograde Amnesia</a>. Another case is that of <a
      href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/06/22/amnesia-memory-lonnie-sue-johnson/">Lonnie Sue Johnson</a> who lost her hippocampus to encephalitis and can now no longer remember
      anything related to her personal life, but retains a lot of skills like how to paint, how to play music, how to fly an airplane etc. <br>
      - Memory has been classically divided into two types: declarative (explicit) and non-declarative (implicit) (<a
      href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Declarative_and_Procedural_Memory_Squire1.pdf">Source</a>). Cases like LSJ question how sharp the boundary
      between the two really is.

        </div>
      </div>

      c) Amygdala: <br>
      - The amygdala is involved in experiencing and recognising emotions. The simple statement that you should remember about what the amygdala does is it does the four Fs:
      fighting, fleeing, feeding, and mating. <br>
      - An interesting case is that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M._(patient)">Patient SM</a> who lost her amygdala to a disease and now no longer registers fear.

      - If you drilled a cylindrical hole right through your brain, this is what it would look like. On the surface of that cylinder would be the cell bodies that forms the grey
      matter of the brain. White matter would be the axons/processes that would be connecting those cells to the different parts of the brain. <br>
      - Why care about white matter: <br>
      1. White matter makes up 45% of the human brain. <br>
      2. We cannot understand cortex without knowing the connections between regions. <br>
      3. The specific connections of each region may serve as a "fingerprint" of that region across species, enabling us to discover interspecies homologies. <br>
      4. The specific connections of each region may play a causal in its development. <br>
      5. Disruptions of white matter may be key to clinical disorders <br>
      6. Structural connections provide a major constraint in circuit design and likely too in brain design. <br>

    <div>
      - Just for refresher, this is what the different parts of the brain functionally look like. Each part of primary sensory cortex is "mapped" to a specific trait of the input
      itself.

      - For the visual cortex, we have Retinotopic Maps. What this means is that the neurons that are present in the visual cortex have a direct correlation to where you are
      looking at. If you are looking at a particular point, it is only that particular neuron (and the ones around it to some extent) that will fire. If you look at a different
      point, it will be a different set of neurons that will fire. Thus, in the visual cortex, you get a direct map of what you see. This is the central idea behind retinotopy:
      adjacent parts of the visual scene are mapped to adjacent parts of the cortex. The "V1 retinotopic map" section in <a
      href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/courses/perception/lecturenotes/V1/lgn-V1.html">this link</a> gives a diagram about how it looks. <br>
      - Similarly, we have maps for the touch senses. Different parts of the body register touch to different parts of the somatic sensory cortex, as shown here:

      </div>

      - Similarly, we have maps for auditory inputs. Different frequencies of sound are mapped to different parts of the Auditory Cortex. <br>
      - So the bottom line is that primary sensory cortex areas have maps. <br>
      - But this leads to the question, what about the rest of the cortex? Are they just mush, or are there separate bits? And if so, do they have maps? And if yes, what are those
      maps of?

    <div class="sub-heading">How do we define what constitutes a "Cortical Area" anyway?</div>
    <div>
      - A cortical area is defined as a region of the cortex that is distinct from its neighbors in: <br>
      a) Function: ie. neurons in this region fire in response to something different than the neurons in the neighboring region. <br>
      b) Connectivity to other areas: each distinct region of the cortex has a different set of connections to other parts of the brain, ie., it has a different "connectivity
      fingerprint". <br>
      c) Distinct layer structures/cell types ("cytoarchitecture") <br>

      - The primary sensory cortical areas satisy all of these and are some of the classical examples of cortical areas. One of the more recent cortical areas identified is known
      as "Visual Motion Area MT". The neurons in this area are mapped to "direction of motion". So depending on which way the stimulus is moving, a different set of neurons are
      fired in each of those cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/bAkuNXtgrLA?t=2081">This video demonstration</a> shows how this works in the case of monkeys. <a
      href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucjtmis/papers/MotionAfterMT95.pdf">This paper</a> states out the experiment conducted to show that the cells in human area MT are also
      direction-specific. So the neurons in the MT region are not only specific to motion, they are also specific to specific direction of motion. <br>
      - This also introduces the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field#Visual_system">receptive field</a>.
