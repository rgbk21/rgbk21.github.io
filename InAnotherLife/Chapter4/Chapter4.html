    - If you're asked to move a note or chord up the guitar neck or to play it higher on the neck, it means higher in pitch, or toward the body of the guitar. If you're asked to go
    down or lower on the neck, it means toward the headstock, or lower in pitch. <br>
    - Strings are counted from the bottom. So if someone says play the second string, you play the second-thinnest string. The names of the open strings are (E, A, D, G, B, E, from
    6th to 1st). An easy way to memorize the open strings in order is to remember the phrase "Eddie Ate Dynamite; Good-Bye, Eddie." <br>

      - <i>Frets</i> are the thin metal bars running perpendicular to the strings that shorten the effective vibrating length of a string, enabling it to produce different
      <i>pitches</i>. <br>
      - <i>Pickups</i> (that are present only in electric guitars) are barlike magnets that create the electrical current, which the amplifier converts into musical sound.
      The vibrations caused when you pick a string disturb, or modulate, the magnetic field that the pickups - wire-wrapped magnets positioned underneath the strings - produce. As
      the vibrations of the strings modulate the pickup's magnetic field, the pickup produces a tiny electric current that exactly reflects that modulation. <br>
      - Any instrument must have some part of it moving in a regular, repeated motion to produce musical sound (a sustained tone, or <i>pitch</i>). In a guitar, this part is
      the vibrating string. If you tune a string of your guitar to different tensions, you get different tones. The greater the tension of a string, the higher the pitch. <br>
      - Instead of changing the tension in the string, there is another method, and that is to change the effective vibrating length of the string by <i>fretting</i>. This is the
      process of changing the vibrating length so that it is only the part of the string between the finger and the bridge that is vibrating. This is how you change the
      <i>pitch</i>. As you shorten the effective vibrating length, the <i>pitch</i> gets higher. This is also why violin has a higher pitch than say a guitar or a cello: shorter
      strings.

    <div class="sub-heading">Intervals, frets, half steps, and tuning</div>
    <div>
      - An <i>interval</i> is defined as the unit of musical difference in pitch. <br>
      - The smallest interval of the musical scale is the <i>half step</i>. <br>
      - On a guitar, <i>frets</i> represent the half steps. To go up or down by half steps on a guitar means to move your left hand one fret at a time, higher or lower on the neck.
      <br>
      - Electronic tuners made especially for guitars can usually sense what string you're playing, tell you what pitch you're nearest, and indicate whether you're <i>flat</i> (too
      low) or <i>sharp</i> (too high). <br>
      - // TODO: There is also relative tuning which does not need any outside reference to which you tune the instrument. As long as the strings are in tune in a certain
      relationship with each other, you can create sonorous and harmonious tones. To tune a guitar using the relative method, choose one string as the starting point - say, the 6th
      string. Leave the pitch of that string as is; then tune all the other strings relative to that 6th string.

    <div class="sub-heading">Holding and playing the guitar</div>
    <div>
      - Don't use the left hand to support the neck. You should be able to take your left hand completely off the fretboard without the guitar dipping toward the floor. <br>
      - To get an idea of correct left-hand positioning on the guitar, extend your left hand, palm up, and make a loose fist, placing your thumb roughly between your first and
      second fingers. All of your knuckles should be bent. Your hand should look about like that after you stick a guitar neck in there. The thumb glides along the back of the
      neck, straighter than if you were making a fist but not rigid. The finger knuckles stay bent whether they're fretting or relaxed. <br>
      - To fret a note, press the tip of your finger down on a string, keeping your knuckles bent. Try to get the fingertip to come down vertically on the string rather than at an
      angle. This position exerts the greatest pressure on the string and also prevents the sides of the finger from touching adjacent strings - which may cause either buzzing or
      muting (deadening the string, or preventing it from ringing). Use your thumb from its position underneath the neck to help "squeeze" the fingerboard for a tighter grip. <br>
      - When playing a particular fret, you don't place your finger directly on the metal fret, but <i>in between</i> the two frets. But not exactly in the middle of the two frets.
      Instead it should be as close to the higher fret as possible. <br>
      - Make sure as well that your left elbow doesn't stick out to the side. You want to keep your upper arm and forearm parallel to the side of your body. Relax your elbow so it
      stays at your side. <br>
      - Electric necks are both narrower (from the 1st string to the 6th) and shallower (from the fingerboard to the back of the neck) than acoustic necks. Electric guitars are,
      therefore, easier to fret. But the space between each string is smaller, so you're more likely to touch and deaden an adjacent string with your fretting finger. The biggest
      difference, however, between fretting on an electric and on a nylon or steel-string acoustic is the <i>action</i>. <br>
      - A guitar's <i>action</i> refers to how high above the frets the strings ride and, to a lesser extent, how easy they are to fret. Electric guitars are easier to fret which
      enables you to use a more relaxed left-hand position than you normally would on an acoustic. <br>
      - Your right hand, held loosely outstretched, crosses the strings at about a 60-degree angle. This position is good for playing with a pick. For fingerstyle playing, you want
      to turn your right hand more perpendicular to the strings. For classical guitar, you want to keep the right hand as close to a 90-degree angle as possible. <br>
      - When holding the pick, it should just be the tip that sticks out, perpendicular to the thumb. <br>
      - If you're strumming (playing rhythm), you strike the strings with the pick by using wrist and elbow motion. The more vigorous the strum, the more elbow you must put into
      the mix. <br>
      - Fingerpicking means that you play the guitar by plucking the strings with the individual right-hand fingers. The thumb plays the bass, or low, strings, and the fingers play
      the treble, or high, strings. In fingerpicking, <i>you use the tips of the fingers to play the strings</i>, positioning the hand over the sound hole (if you're playing
      acoustic) and keeping the wrist stationary but not rigid. Maintaining a slight arch in the wrist so the fingers come down more vertically on the strings also helps.

    <div class="sub-heading">What is a note? What is a Chord?</div>
    <div>
      - Each string on the guitar is associated with a note. A <i>note</i> can be described as the tuning of a particular string on the guitar. Or in other words, guitar notes are
      individual pitches. <br>
      - For instance, in the standard tuning, the thickest string - the one that produces the lowest sound - is tuned to an <i>E note</i>. This is referred to as the low E string
      so as not to be confused with the other E string. Similarly, going from the thickest to the thinnest, we have the A string tuned to the A note, D string tuned to the D note,
      G string tuned to the G note, B string tuned to the B note, and finally the highest and the thinnest string tuned to the E note. This E note is two times higher than your low
      E string. <a href="https://acousticlife.tv/guitar-notes-for-beginners/">Source</a>. <br>
      - This is an image of all the notes on the fretboard (<a href="https://yousician.com/blog/guitar-fretboard-learning-guide">Source</a>). The thickest E string is at the bottom
      of the image and the thinnest E string at the top. Note that some notes seem to have two names. You'll see that each one has a note with a sharp (#) and a note with a flat
      (b). This is because these notes are 'in between' notes that are identified with just one letter. <br>
      - For example, look at the note on the fifth fret of the A string-it's a D. Go two frets up to the seventh fret and you have an E. So what about the note in the middle on the
      sixth fret? How to read this note depends on the context and point of view. If you take the E note and lower it one fret, you have an Eb. At the same time, if you take the D
      note and raise it one fret you have a D#. Same note, same string, same location on the fretboard. The point is that both names mean the same note. <br>
      - A <i>chord</i> is defined as the simultaneous sounding of three or more notes.

    <div class="sub-heading">How to read a chord diagram?</div>
    <div>
      - If a chord is to be played somewhere beyond the first four frets, a numeral appears to the right of the diagram, next to the top fret line, to indicate in which fret the
      diagram actually starts. (In such cases, the top line is not the nut.) In most cases, however, you deal primarily with chords that fall within only the first four frets of
      the guitar. <br>
      - Chords that fall within the first four frets typically use open strings, so they're referred to as <i>open chords</i>.

    <div class="sub-heading">What is tablature?</div>
    <div>
      - <i>Tablature</i> shows you how you play music over a period of time. Tab doesn't tell you what <i>note</i> to play (such as C or F# or Eb). It does, however, tell you what
      <i>string</i> to fret and where exactly on the fingerboard to <i>fret</i> that string. <br>
      - Consider the diagram below. The top line of the tab represents the 1st string og the guitar - high E. The bottom line of the tab corresponds to the 6th string on the
      guitar, low E. A number appearing on any given line tells you to fret that string in that numbered fret. A 0 on a line means you play the open string. <br>
      - For example, when you see the number 3 on the 4th string from the top, you need to press down on the 3rd fret on the String 4. <br>
      - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FofCWizp43Y">YT tutorial by Justin</a> goes into how to read tablature.

      - Buzzing results if you're not pressing down quite hard enough when you fret. A buzz can also result if a fretting finger accidentally comes in contact with an adjacent
      string, preventing that string from ringing freely. Without removing your fingers from the frets, try "rocking and rolling" your fingers around on their tips to eliminate any
      buzzes when you strum the chord.

      - The below diagram shows the entire range of notes (including sharps and flats) on the guitar on the treble clef using ledger lines above and below the staff. All 12
      frets of each of the six strings are shown on the staff, which allows you to see how to play some pitches on multiple strings. The lowest possible note is the open low-E
      string, three ledger lines and a space below the treble staff. The highest note is E, three ledger lines above the staff.

      - An <i>interval</i> is the distance between two notes. All intervals have a name. <br>
      - For understanding intervals, we need to understand what half-steps and whole steps are (also known as whole tones or semi-tones). <br>
      - A half-step is the distance between two notes that are one fret apart (semi-tone). A whole step is two frets apart (whole tone).

      - We looked at the names of the intervals as we moved up the neck of the guitar in the previous section. Now we will map that to the intervals between two strings. Note that
      for the sake of this comparison, we are talking about when the guitar is using the standard tuning. <br>
      - The interval between E and A is a perfect 4th. From the table above, we know that a perfect 4th means an interval of 2 and a half steps. So what this would mean is that
      picking the open E string and then picking the open A string would cause the same frequency difference if we were picking the open E string and then picked the 5th fret of
      the E string (?). <br>
      - The figure below shows that the interval between all the strings, except the B and G, is a Perfect 4th (2 and a half steps). Between the B and G string, the interval is a
      Major 3rd (2 whole steps).

      - The below image shows how to translate intervals on the same string to intervals on different strings. This is using the same logic that we looked above, ie. the interval
      between the E and A string is a Perfect 4th.
      <div class="image-block">

      - The below image shows how to move one sample interval through all the string sets. We are going to take a Major 3rd interval. We are not worried about the notes that are
      being played right now. We just want to see the interval shapes and how they change.
