		<div>Really, another page? Was a facebook page, a linkedin, a blog, and a github not sufficient to display everything you had to offer?</div>
		<div>What could this page possibly contain that could not be subsumed by the other plethora of accounts that you have so wantingly created?</div>
		<div>Well, to you internet stranger, I say you are crazy, and also correct. But yet, here we both are. So let's get down to business, shall we?</div>
		<br>
		<div>Hi there! I am Gaurav. The motive behind creating this page is more as a service to myself than to you, the reader. I hope this page to serve as a one stop thant indexes all the things (projects, notes, code, blogs) that I have created or will create, both in the past and the future. At the same time, it serves as a central repository for all things, academic and otherwise, that have interested me over the years and continue to interest me today as well. So, depending on the section you find yourself in, you might be looking at concrete mathematical proofs or the incoherent ramblings of a juvenile delinquent (that's how my major adviser described me by the way. The delinquent part. Not the mathematical proof part. Obviously).</div>
		<br>
		<div>I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from Iowa State University, US. I completed my undergrad in Electronics and Communications Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India. I worked for around 6 years in Ericsson after which I decided to pursue higher studies and found myself half way around the world in Ames, from where I am writing this right now. The town of Ames goes into deep slumber over the summers, with nearly half the total population depleted. Between the thesis and the bi-weekly research meetings, there really is not much to do. So you would be right to expect frequent updates on this page.</div>
		<br>
		<div>One of the primary reasons of creating this page is to maintain an online repository of notes of the lectures that I have really enjoyed during my Maters here. You can find all of these notes in the Notes section on the nav bar. If you have any suggestions for the site, or would just like to chat, or just want to berate me for no apparent reason, send me a mail: gaurav@iastate.edu</div>	
		<br>
		<div>Site under construction. </div>
		<div>More stuff coming soon!</div>
