    <div id="Ch1_Angular" class="chapter">Chapter 1: Angular - A Modern Web Platform</div>
    <hr>
    <div class="textual-content">

        <div class="sub-heading">Why should Angular be viewed as a <i>platform</i>, and not a <i>framework</i>?</div>
        <div>
            - A <i>framework</i> is usually just the code library used to build an application, whereas a
            <i>platform</i> is
            more holistic and includes tooling and support beyond a framework. AngularJS was
            focused solely on building web applications in the browser and was clearly a framework.
            Angular, on the other hand, provides many other features such as: <br>
            <li>
                <b>Dedicated CLI for application development, testing, and deployment</b>:
                You can install the CLI using npm: <code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>
                To see the full list of features, you can run <code>ng help</code> to output the current help
                documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Offline rendering capabilities on many back-end server platforms</b>:
                Compiling output in Angular is decoupled from the browser in a way that allows Angular applications to
                be rendered in different environments, such as a server or desktop app. The compiler in Angular is
                responsible for
                resolving data bindings, registering event handlers, and rendering out the resulting HTML for
                components. The term <i>server rendering</i> is about the notion that it shouldn't matter where you run
                the JavaScript engine that executes Angular code. It should be possible to run Angular universally, such
                as with browser JavaScript engines, NodeJS, or even less common
                engines like Java's Nashorn engine. This greatly increases the ways in which Angular
                can be used. Server rendering allows for faster loading on mobile devices and improves the
                performance/reponsiveness of the app in the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Desktop-, mobile-, and browser-based application execution environments</b>:
                Angular's rendering design makes it possible to support rendering out to different native platforms.
                This means you can share a lot of code between your Angular applications, even if some are designed to
                build mobile apps and others are web applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Comprehensive UI component libraries, such as Material Design</b>:
                Rather than having to build your own charts or tabs components, you can use one of the many prebuilt
                options.
            </li>

            ..hence classifying it as a platform rather than just a framework.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">What is a Component?</div>
        <div>
            - Component is a way to create custom HTML elements in your application. <br>
            - When we build components, the following are the tenets we should consider when
            designing the best components possible.
            <li>Encapsulation - Keeping component logic in a single place</li>
            <li>Isolation - Keeping component internals hidden from external actors</li>
            <li>Reusability - Allowing component reuse with minimal effort</li>
            <li>Evented - Emitting events during the lifecycle of the component</li>
            <li>Customizable - Making it possible to style and extend the component</li>
            <li>Declarative - Using a component with simple declarative markup</li>

            <br>
            - The following 4 ideas are central to the definition of Components: <br>
            <li>
                <b>Custom elements (encapsulation, declarative, reusability, evented)</b>:
                <i>Custom elements</i> means being able to extend HTML with our own additional elements. You can read
                more <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/">here</a>. Custom elements have a lot of the stuff
                necessary for building components. It gives us a <i>declarative</i> way to create
                a <i>reusable</i> component, which <i>encapsulates</i> the internal mechanics of the component away
                from the rest of the application, but can emit <i>events</i> to enable other components to hook
                into the lifecycle. Angular uses these concepts in its implementation of components. Every Angular
                component is a custom element and fulfills the four
                tenets (and more) that we expect to get from a custom element.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Shadow DOM</b>: The Shadow DOM is an isolated Document Object Model (DOM) tree that's detached from
                the typical CSS inheritance, allowing you to create a barrier between markup inside and outside of the
                Shadow DOM. For example, if you have a button inside of a Shadow DOM
                and a button outside, any CSS for the button written outside the Shadow DOM won't
                affect the button inside it. This is important for Angular because it allows us to have
                better control over how CSS affects the way the components display.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Templates</b>: Templates allow us to create isolated fragments of the DOM to use in our components.
                Read more about it <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element">here</a>.
                Templates are often used with the Shadow DOM because it allows you to define the
                template and then inject it into the shadow root. Without templates, the Shadow DOM
                APIs would require us to inject content node by node. They're also used by Angular as
                part of the lifecycle of components and the compilation process, allowing Angular to
                keep isolated, inert copies of the template as data changes and needs to be recompiled.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>JavaScript modules</b>: Modules are an isolated
                piece of JavaScript that can be used to generate a component, create a reusable service,
                or do anything else JavaScript can do. They're fundamentally a way to encapsulate application code and
                choose what's available for the other parts of the application to use. In JavaScript, a module is any
                file of JavaScript code that contains the <code>export</code> keyword. Modules export values that they
                want to expose to the application and can keep other parts of the internal logic private. Then, in order
                to use an exported value, you have to first import it from another module. Executing an Angular
                application is fundamentally loading a module that contains the application bootstrapping logic, which
                in turn starts to load and trigger additional modules.
            </li>

        <div class="sub-heading">How Angular renders the base application</div>
        <div>
            - Angular requires at least one component and one module. A <i>component</i> is the basic
            building block of Angular applications and acts much like any other HTML element. A
            <i>module</i> is a way for Angular to organize different parts of the application into a single
            unit that Angular can understand. Components are for functionality and structure, whereas
            modules are for packaging and distribution. You might think of components as LEGO bricks,
            which can be many different shapes, sizes, and colors, and modules would be the packaging the LEGOs come in.
        </div>

        <br>

        <li>
            <b>App Component</b>: <br>
            - Look at <code>src/app/app.component.ts</code> in the project. <br>
            -The <code>@Component</code> annotation declares that this class is a component by accepting an
            object. <br>
            - It has a <code>selector</code> property that declares the HTML selector of the component.
            That means the component is used in the template by adding an HTML tag
            <code>&ltapp-root&gt&lt/app-root&gt</code>. <br>
            - The <code>templateUrl</code> property declares a link to a template containing an HTML template. <br>
            - The <code>styleUrls</code> property contains an array of links to any CSS files that
            should be loaded for this component. <br>
            - The AppComponent class has a single property called <code>title</code>. The
            value is what you should see rendered in the browser, so this is the source of the value
            that ultimately appears.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/22531cd0ea803b59fd577ca92558ac80.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Now look at <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> in the project. <br>
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/f00cb1cbd089f479ba3e29ca6a011476.js"></script>
            </div>
            - This is just a simple header tag, but there's the title property defined
            between double curly braces. This is a common convention for how to bind a value into a template. It means
            Angular
            will replace <code>{{title}}</code> with the value of the title property from the component.
            This is called <i>interpolation</i> and is frequently used to display data in a template.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <b>App Module</b>: <br>
            - The App module is the packaging that helps tell Angular what's available to render. It also describes the
            various dependencies that are needed to render the module.
            There's at least one module in an application, but it's possible to create multiple modules for different
            reasons<br>
            - The CLI generated the module for us, so we can look at it in <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/c71f0473dd8024737c3f5b5ee5af6d5a.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Just like a component, a module is an object with a decorator. The object here is
            called <code>AppModule</code>, and <code>NgModule</code> is the decorator. <br>
            - The first block is to import any Angular dependencies that are common to most apps and the App component.
            <br>
            - The <code>NgModule</code> decorator takes an object with a few different properties. The
            <code>declarations</code> property is to provide a list of any components and directives to make available
            to the entire application. <br>
            - The <code>imports</code> property is an array of other modules upon which this module depends - in this
            case, the <code>BrowserModule</code>
            (a collection of required capabilities). If you ever include other modules, such as third-party modules or
            ones you've created, they also need to be listed here. <br>
            - The next property is the <code>providers</code> property, which is empty by default. Any services
            that are created are to be listed here. <br>
            - The <code>bootstrap</code> property defines which components to bootstrap at runtime. Typically, this will
            be the same
            App component, and the CLI already set it up for us.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <b>Bootstrapping the app</b>: <br>
            - The application must be bootstrapped at runtime to start the process of rendering. <br>
            - Look at <code>angular.json</code> file. One of the properties is the <code>main</code> property. By
            default, it points to the <code>src/app/main.ts</code> file. <br>
            - This means that when the application gets built, it will automatically call the contents of
            the <code>main.ts</code> file as the first set of instructions. <br>
            - The role of main.ts is to bootstrap the Angular application. It is located in:
            <code>src/app/main.ts</code>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b3bb160cdcd82cd9bc167fd07e62dd71.js"></script>
            </div>

            - The <code>platformBrowserDynamic</code> object is used to tell Angular which module is being loading, and
            in this case that's the <code>AppModule</code>. It is important to understand that this is the point where
            the code begins to execute. <br>
            - You should see the following in the <code>src/index.html</code> file:

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/6b8dda863e460873ebce15d73b3ef8ad.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Once the app is bootstrapped by the main.ts code, Angular will look for
            the <code>app-root</code> element and replace it with the rendered component. <br>
            - And thus the sequence of loading the app is complete. The process can be understood as follows: <br>
            - When the application gets built, it automatically calls the contents of <code>main.ts</code>. <code>main.ts</code>
            bootstraps the <code>AppModule</code>. The control passes to the <code>app.module.ts</code> where it sees
            the field <code>bootstrap</code> and figures out which component to use as the first in order to bootstrap
            the application. Control then goes to the <code>app.component.ts</code> class where it sees the <code>templateUrl</code>
            that it has to serve along with the <code>selector</code> <code>app-root</code>.

        </li>

        <div class="sub-heading">Building Services</div>
        <div>
            - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16709882/8742428">SO Link</a> for when to use Services. Services come
            in handy in the following scenarios: <br>
            a) When you want to share information between two or more controllers - One may use <code>$rootScope</code>
            to also communicate between controllers, but it should be avoided as much as possible since it is a global
            scope. <br>
            b) When a functionality is to be used multiple times. <br>
            - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/36199007/8742428">SO link</a> for how to create a Singleton Service.
            <br>
            - Services are objects that abstract some common logic that you plan to reuse in multiple places. Think of
            services is as sharable objects that any part of your app can import as needed. They can do about anything
            you need them to do, because they're objects. Using ES2015 modules, these classes are exported, and so any
            component can import them as necessary. They could also have functions or even static values, like a string
            or number, as a way to share data between various parts of your application. <br>
            - To generate a Service you run the following: <code>ng generate service services/stocks</code>.
            The CLI will generate the files in the <code>src/app/services</code> directory. <br>
            - Add the following code to the auto-generated class.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0b460a32144e8fa69e77b6ee4af7d034.js"></script>
            </div>

            - The <code>StocksService</code> class is exported and is decorated by the <code>Injectable</code>
            decorator. The decorator is used to set up the proper wiring for Angular to know how to use it elsewhere, so
            if you forget to include the decorator, the class might not be injectable into your application. <br>
            - In the constructor method, the <code>HttpClient</code> service is injected using the TypeScript
            technique of declaring a private variable called <code>http</code> and then giving it a type of <code>HttpClient</code>.
            <br>
            - The <code>load()</code> method makes a call to the <code>HttpClient</code> service to load the data for
            current stock price values. The <code>HttpClient</code> service is called and returns an observable, which
            is a construct for handling asynchronous events, such as data from an API call. <br>
            - The <code>this.http.get&ltArray&ltStockInterface&gt&gt</code> is the <i>type variable</i>. This is a
            feature of TypeScript that tells it what kind of object it should expect. In this case it will expect
            to get an array of objects that conform to the <code>StockInterface</code>. <br>
            - There is one last thing that we have to do - in the <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> file

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b4f0023fac33831f9ae61231d22e544c.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Creating your first Component</div>
        <div>
            - Generate a new component by running the following: <code>ng generate component components/summary</code>
            <br>
            - The CLI will generate a new component inside the <code>src/app/components/summary</code> directory. <br>
            - The generated component contains an empty CSS file, basic HTML template, test stub, and empty class
            already initialized with the component annotation.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/138d4356d6c544e24367ff12f3c6719a.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Line 1,2 <code>[ngClass]="{increase:isPositive(), decrease: isNegative()}</code> is a special kind of
            attribute known as a <i>Directive</i>. Directives allow you to modify the behavior and display of DOM
            elements in a template. <br>
            - The NgClass directive is able to add or remove CSS classes to and from the element. It's assigned a value,
            which is an object that contains properties that are the CSS class names, and those properties map to a
            method on the controller (to be written). If the method returns true, it will add the class; if false, it
            will be removed. In this snippet, the card will get the <code>increase</code> CSS class when it's positive,
            or the <code>decrease</code> CSS class when it's negative.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Let's move to <code>{{stock?.symbol?.toUpperCase()}}</code>. The double curly braces syntax is the way to
            display some value in the page (interpolation). The content between the braces is called an <i>Angular
            expression</i> and is evaluated against the controller (like the directive), meaning that it will try to
            find a property on the controller to display. If it fails, normally it will throw an error, but the safe
            navigation operator <code>?.</code> will silently fail and not display anything if the property is missing.
            <br>
            <br>
            - <code>{{stock?.lastTradePriceOnly | currency:'USD':'symbol':'.2'}}</code> shows another feature of Angular
            called <i>pipes</i>, which are added directly into the expression to format the output. The interpolation
            expression is extended with a pipe symbol, <code> | </code>, and then a pipe is named and optionally
            configured with values separated with the colon <code> : </code> symbol. Pipes only modify the data before
            it is displayed, and do not change the value in the controller. The double curly braces indicate that you
            want to bind the data stored in the <code>stock.lastTradePriceOnly</code> property to display it. The data
            is piped through the Currency pipe, which converts the value into a financial figure based on a USD figure,
            and rounds to two decimal points.
            <br>
            <br>
            - <code>{{stock?.change | currency:'USD':'symbol':'.2'}} ({{stock?.changeInPercent | percent:'.2'}})</code>
            has two different interpolation bindings with a currency or a Percentage pipe. The first will convert to the
            same currency format, but the second will take a percentage as a decimal, such as 0.06, and turn it into 6%.
            Note that the round brackets in the second interpolation are not the part of any syntax, they are just there
            because the UI needs that value to be in round brackets.

            <br>
            <br>
            - The <code>summary.component.html</code> template needs a controller to wire up the data and the methods.
            Make the following changes to the <code>src/app/components/summary/summary.component.ts</code> file. <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e6b68f792de74885c59302cc18ca5e34.js"></script>
            </div>

            - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35763730/difference-between-constructor-and-ngoninit">SO
            Link</a> explaining why we need to use <code>ngOnInit</code> if we already have a <code>constructor</code>?
            <br>
            - The summary controller class starts with a property called <code>stock</code>, which is preceded
            with the <code>Input</code> annotation. This indicates that this property is to be provided to the
            component by a parent component passing it to the summary.

            <br>
            <br>
            - We also want to apply certain styling to the summary.
            Open the <code>src/app/components/summary/summary.component.css</code> file. <br>
            - The <code>:host</code> selector is used because we want components to be as self-contained as possible.
            This relies on the Shadow DOM concepts discussed earlier. When Angular renders this component,
            it will modify the output to ensure that the CSS selector is unique and doesn't accidentally interfere with
            other elements on the page. <br>
            - The host selector is a way to specify that you want the styles to apply to the element
            that hosts the element, so in this case it will look at the Summary component element
            itself rather than the contents inside it.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/169556a4dab7e3f45af12ef35c0409e5.js"></script>
            </div>

            <br>
            - Look at the <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> file and you'll see that the CLI already modified
            the module to include the Summary component in the App module. <br>
            - Now update the contents of the <code>src/app/app.component.ts</code> file.
            - We store the loaded stock data onto a property called stocks. We also provide some typing information,
            which is imported from our Stocks service, so that TypeScript knows what kind of value to expect. Finally,
            instead of logging the data to the console, we store it on the stocks property.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8031c83dded48742f24ccdd3c30fffe9.js"></script>
            </div>

            <br>
            - Now we need to change the <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> file to use the Summary Component. <br>
            - The first line added <code>*ngIf="stocks"</code>, which is a directive that will only render the contents
            inside the element when the expression is true. In this case, it won't render the Summary component until
            the stock data has been loaded. <br>
            - The middle line shows the instantiation of a single Summary component, and the first value of the stocks
            array is bound into the stock property. The data returns as an array, so we're directly accessing the first
            value. Recall the input value we declared in the Summary component, which is also named stock. <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/c207e2cfee4c2da13801740d41f6f5f5.js"></script>
            </div>

            - If everything was set up correctly, you should now see your first Component that displays a Summary card
            for the current stock value of AAPL!!!!

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Components that use Components and Services</div>
        <div>
            - Generate another Component: <code>ng generate component components/dashboard</code>. This will output new
            files into the src/app/components/dashboard directory for the HTML, CSS, controller, and unit test. It also
            adds the component to the App module (app.module.ts) to be immediately consumable. <br>
            - Make the following changes to <code> src/app/components/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts</code>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b844691d2db52f978909cdf8dc2c7a0a.js"></script>
            </div>

            - The <code>DashboardComponent</code> class is the component controller, and it declares that it
            must implement the requirements of <code>OnInit</code>. If it doesn't, TypeScript will fail to compile the
            code and throw an error. It then has two properties: an array of stocks and an
            array of strings that represent the stock symbols to display. Initially they're empty arrays,
            so we'll need to get them loaded for the component to render. <br>
            - The <code>constructor</code> method runs as soon as the component is created. It will import
            the Stocks service onto the <code>service</code> property and then request the current list of stock
            symbols from it. This works because this is a synchronous action that loads a value directly from memory.
            <br>
            - But we don't load data from the service in the constructor for a number of reasons. The constructor fires
            early in the rendering of a component, which means that often, values are not yet ready to be consumed.
            Components expose a number of lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute commands at various stages of
            rendering, giving you greater control over when things occur. <br>
            - In our code, we use the <code>ngOnInit</code> lifecycle hook to call the service to load the stock
            data. It uses the list of stock symbols that was loaded in the constructor. We then <code>subscribe</code>
            to wait for the results to return and store them in the stocks property. This uses the observable approach
            to handling asynchronous requests. We are using obervables because the <code>HttpClient</code> returns an
            observable for us to receive the response. This is exposed as a stream of data, even though it is
            a single event.
            <br>
            <br>
            - The last step is to change the <code>src/app/components/dashboard/dashboard.component.html</code> file.
            <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/1c7c13475c871df7faa086512766d12e.js"></script>
            </div>

            - We see another element that has a new directive, NgFor. Like NgIf, it starts with
            an <code> * </code> <br>
            - <code>NgFor</code> will then create an instance of the Summary component for each of the stock
            items. It binds the stock data into the component. Each copy of the Summary component is distinct from the
            others, and they don't directly share data.

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Components with forms and events</div>
        <div>
            - Forms are essential in applications, and Angular comes with built-in support for building complex forms
            with many features. Forms in Angular are comprised of any number of <code>controls</code>, which are the
            various types of inputs and fields the form may contain (such as a text input, a checkbox, or some custom
            lement). <br>
            - First, create a new component using <code>ng generate component components/manage</code>. Now update the
            <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> so that it is the <code>app-manage</code> component that is beign
            served. <br>
            - We also need to add the <code>FormsModule</code> to our application, because we are going to use
            the form features that aren't automatically included by Angular. Open up the
            <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> file and add a new import:
            <code>import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';</code> <br>
            - Open <code>src/app/components/manage/manage.component.ts</code> and add the following: <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/3fb32efac06faef8811d822865c561db.js"></script>
            </div>

            - The constructor uses the service to get the array of stock symbols and store it on the
            symbols property. This doesn't require the <code>OnInit</code> lifecycle hook, because it's a synchronous
            request to get data that exists in memory.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/33b47bc2e7bb7cd65fc4f38353f08228.js"></script>
            </div>

            - The <code>(submit)="add()"</code> attribute is a way to add an event listener, known
            as an <code>event binding</code>. When the form is submitted (which is done by pressing Enter), it
            will call the <code>add</code> method. Any attribute that's surrounded by parentheses is an event
            binding, and the name of the event should match the event without the <code> on </code>
            (<code>onsubmit</code>
            is <code>submit</code>). <br>
            - The <code>[(ngModel)]="stock"</code> attribute is a <i>two-way binding</i> that will sync the value of the
            input and the value of the property in the controller anytime it changes from either
            location. This way, as the user types into the text field, the value will be immediately
            available for the controller to consume. When the user hits Enter, the <code>submit</code> event
            fires and will use the value of the stock property when adding the new symbol. <br>
            - The next section loops over the list of symbols using NgFor. For each <code>symbol</code>, it will create
            a local variable called <code>symbol</code>, create a new table row that binds the value, and a button
            that's for removing the item. <br>
            - The <code>remove</code> button contains another event binding, this one to handle the click
            event. The <code>(click)="remove(symbol)"</code> attribute adds an event listener to the click
            event and will call the <code>remove</code> method in the controller, passing along the symbol.
            Because there are multiple instances of the button, each one passes along the local variable to know which
            symbol to remove.

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Application Routing</div>
        <div>
            - <i>Routing</i> configures the different pages that the application can render. Angular has a router that
            works well with the Angular architecture by mapping components to routes. <br>
            - Create a new file at <code>src/app/app.routes.ts</code> <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ace5de14640001570352a6f5ff09bc5f.js"></script>
            </div>

            - The <code>RouterModule</code> is used to activate the router and accepts the routes configuration when
            it's initialized. We also import the two routable components, the Dashboard and Manage components, so we
            can reference them properly in our routes configuration. <br>
            - The routes are defined as an array of objects that have at least one property - in this case two, for a
            URL path and a component. For the first route, there's no path, so it acts as the application index (which
            will be http://localhost:4200) and links to the Dashboard component. The second route provides a URL path of
            manage (which will be http://localhost:4200/manage) and links to the Manage component. <br>
            - Finally, we create a new value <code>AppRoutes</code>, which is assigned to the result of
            <code>RouterModule.forRoot(routes)</code>. It's a way to pass configuration to the module. In this case,
            we're passing the array of routes. We export this so we can import it into our App module and register it.

            <br>
            <br>

            - In <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> add <code>import { AppRoutes } from './app.routes';</code> and
            update the <code>imports</code> array to contain <code>AppRoutes</code>.

            <br>
            <br>

            - In the <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> file, make the following changes:

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/a80d7f8853c79ce4ff6536492af48aff.js"></script>
            </div>
            - This declares the specific location in the application that the router should render the
            component. It's the same place that we've put our components while building them, so
            it should make sense that this is the best place. <br>
            - Then we need to update the links to use a new directive that will set up the navigation
            between routes. The RouterLink directive binds to an array of paths that are used to
            build a URL. The directive parses the array and tries to match to a known route. Once it matches a
            route, it will add an href to the anchor tag that correctly links to that route.
