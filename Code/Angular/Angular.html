    - <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/typescript/">Link to LearnXInYMinutes</a> where x = Typescript.
    <br>
    - ES5 is short for "ECMAScript 5", otherwise known as "regular JavaScript". ES5 is the normal JavaScript we all
    know. It runs in more-or-less every browser. ES6 is the next version of JavaScript. The TypeScript transpiler
    takes our TypeScript code as input and outputs ES5 code that nearly all browsers understand. If we wanted to
    convert ES6 code (not TypeScript) to ES5 there are two major ES6-to-ES5 transpilers: <code>traceur</code> by
    Google and <code>babel</code> created by the JavaScript community. <br>
    - You can install TypeScript using: <code>npm install -g typescript</code><br>

    <div class="sub-heading">What do we get with TypeScript</div>
    <div>
      - There are 5 big differences that TypeScript brings in over ES5: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>types</li>
        <li>classes</li>
        <li>decorators</li>
        <li>imports</li>
        <li>language utilities (eg. Destructuring)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Types</div>
    <div>
      - Consider the following example:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/492d8825b85fa91f9fb0dd200b4d292b.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - In the above example we are defining a new function called <code>greetText</code> which takes one argument
      called <code>name</code>. The syntax <code>name: string</code> represents that the function expects <code>name</code>
      to be a <code>string</code>. Our code will not compile if we call this function with anything other than a
      <code>string</code>. <br>
      - <code>greetText</code> also has a syntax after the parentheses <code> : string { //code }</code>. The
      colon specifies that we will specify a return type for this function - which in this case is a
      <code>string</code>. You you try returning a <code>number</code> instead, it will throw an error.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Built-in types</div>
    <div>
      - Some examples of built in types are as follows:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/c5a6582d1dd3d575982e43de0fe70966.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Classes</div>
    <div>
      - In JavaScript ES5 object oriented programming was accomplished by using prototype-based objects. This
      model doesn't use classes, but instead relies on <i>prototypes</i>. In ES6 we finally have built-in classes
      in JavaScript. <br>
      - To define a <code>class</code>, we do this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/486bc29f92e4bc99856374fbc0e847c0.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - A class can have <i>properties</i>, <i>methods</i>, and <code>constructors</code>. <br>
      - To instantiate a class, we use the <code>new</code> keyword. Use new Person() to create
      a new instance of the Person class, for example.
      <br><br>
      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Properties</p>: <br>
        - Properties define data attached to an instance of a class. For example, a class named
        Person might have properties like first_name, last_name and age. <br>
        - Each property in a class can optionally have a type. For example, we could say that the
        first_name and last_name properties are strings and the age property is a number. <br>
        - The declaration for a Person class that looks like this:
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
            <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/f1f6a057d70dc4f9a859ab2ab638c6a2.js"></script>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Methods</p>: <br>
        - Methods are functions that run in context of an object. To call a method on an object, we first have
        to have an instance of that object. <br>
        - When methods don't declare an explicit returning type and return a value, it's assumed they can return
        anything (<code>any</code> type). Note that a <code>void</code> value is also a valid <code>any</code>
        value. <br>
        - Consider the Person class declared above again:
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
            <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e8823dd9de31f5057b5fcbd3ca05fde4.js"></script>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Constructors</p>: <br>
        - Constructor methods must be named <code>constructor</code>. They can optionally take parameters but
        they can't return any values, since they are called when the class is being instantiated (i.e. an
        instance of the class is being created, no other value can be returned). <br>
        - When a class has no constructor defined explicitly one will be created automatically. <br>
        - In TypeScript you can have only one constructor per class. That is a departure from ES6 which allows
        one class to have more than one constructor as long as they have a different number of parameters. <br>
        - So how do you manage trying to have multiple constructors in typescript? You use optional parameters. As shown on <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/61154585/8742428">this SO answer here</a>. <br>
        - Adding a constructor to our Person class, we get: <br>
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
            <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/137e25a720e2db724905cafdaaf65c51.js"></script>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Inheritance</p>: <br>
        - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">Read
        more at MDN</a> about what inheritance is all about. <br>
        - Inheritance is a way to indicate that a class receives behavior from a parent class. Then we can
        override, modify or augment those behaviors on the new class. <br>
        - Inheritance is achieved through the <code>extends</code> keyword. <br>
        - Consider the following example: <br>
        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
            <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/6592a956d71235f245d29a284f1059ef.js"></script>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Fat Arrow Functions</div>
    <div>
      - Fat arrow <code>=></code> functions are a shorthand notation for writing functions. <br>
      - Consider the run() function we wrote above and let us see how we can re-write it as an arrow function<br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

  <div id="Ch1_Angular" class="chapter">Chapter 1: Angular - A Modern Web Platform</div>
  <hr>
  <div class="textual-content">

    <div class="sub-heading">Why should Angular be viewed as a <i>platform</i>, and not a <i>framework</i>?</div>
    <div>
      - A <i>framework</i> is usually just the code library used to build an application, whereas a
      <i>platform</i> is
      more holistic and includes tooling and support beyond a framework. AngularJS was
      focused solely on building web applications in the browser and was clearly a framework.
      Angular, on the other hand, provides many other features such as: <br>
      <li>
        <b>Dedicated CLI for application development, testing, and deployment</b>:
        You can install the CLI using npm: <code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>
        To see the full list of features, you can run <code>ng help</code> to output the current help
        documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Offline rendering capabilities on many back-end server platforms</b>:
        Compiling output in Angular is decoupled from the browser in a way that allows Angular applications to
        be rendered in different environments, such as a server or desktop app. The compiler in Angular is
        responsible for
        resolving data bindings, registering event handlers, and rendering out the resulting HTML for
        components. The term <i>server rendering</i> is about the notion that it shouldn't matter where you run
        the JavaScript engine that executes Angular code. It should be possible to run Angular universally, such
        as with browser JavaScript engines, NodeJS, or even less common
        engines like Java's Nashorn engine. This greatly increases the ways in which Angular
        can be used. Server rendering allows for faster loading on mobile devices and improves the
        performance/reponsiveness of the app in the browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Desktop-, mobile-, and browser-based application execution environments</b>:
        Angular's rendering design makes it possible to support rendering out to different native platforms.
        This means you can share a lot of code between your Angular applications, even if some are designed to
        build mobile apps and others are web applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Comprehensive UI component libraries, such as Material Design</b>:
        Rather than having to build your own charts or tabs components, you can use one of the many prebuilt
        options.
      </li>

      ..hence classifying it as a platform rather than just a framework.

    <div class="sub-heading">What is a Component?</div>
    <div>
      - Component is a way to create custom HTML elements in your application. <br>
      - When we build components, the following are the tenets we should consider when
      designing the best components possible.
      <li>Encapsulation - Keeping component logic in a single place</li>
      <li>Isolation - Keeping component internals hidden from external actors</li>
      <li>Reusability - Allowing component reuse with minimal effort</li>
      <li>Evented - Emitting events during the lifecycle of the component</li>
      <li>Customizable - Making it possible to style and extend the component</li>
      <li>Declarative - Using a component with simple declarative markup</li>

      <br>
      - The following 4 ideas are central to the definition of Components: <br>
      <li>
        <b>Custom elements (encapsulation, declarative, reusability, evented)</b>:
        <i>Custom elements</i> means being able to extend HTML with our own additional elements. You can read
        more <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/">here</a>. Custom elements have a lot of the stuff
        necessary for building components. It gives us a <i>declarative</i> way to create
        a <i>reusable</i> component, which <i>encapsulates</i> the internal mechanics of the component away
        from the rest of the application, but can emit <i>events</i> to enable other components to hook
        into the lifecycle. Angular uses these concepts in its implementation of components. Every Angular
        component is a custom element and fulfills the four
        tenets (and more) that we expect to get from a custom element.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Shadow DOM</b>: The Shadow DOM is an isolated Document Object Model (DOM) tree that's detached from
        the typical CSS inheritance, allowing you to create a barrier between markup inside and outside of the
        Shadow DOM. For example, if you have a button inside of a Shadow DOM
        and a button outside, any CSS for the button written outside the Shadow DOM won't
        affect the button inside it. This is important for Angular because it allows us to have
        better control over how CSS affects the way the components display.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Templates</b>: Templates allow us to create isolated fragments of the DOM to use in our components.
        Read more about it <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element">here</a>.
        Templates are often used with the Shadow DOM because it allows you to define the
        template and then inject it into the shadow root. Without templates, the Shadow DOM
        APIs would require us to inject content node by node. They're also used by Angular as
        part of the lifecycle of components and the compilation process, allowing Angular to
        keep isolated, inert copies of the template as data changes and needs to be recompiled.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>JavaScript modules</b>: Modules are an isolated
        piece of JavaScript that can be used to generate a component, create a reusable service,
        or do anything else JavaScript can do. They're fundamentally a way to encapsulate application code and
        choose what's available for the other parts of the application to use. In JavaScript, a module is any
        file of JavaScript code that contains the <code>export</code> keyword. Modules export values that they
        want to expose to the application and can keep other parts of the internal logic private. Then, in order
        to use an exported value, you have to first import it from another module. Executing an Angular
        application is fundamentally loading a module that contains the application bootstrapping logic, which
        in turn starts to load and trigger additional modules.

    <div class="sub-heading">How Angular renders the base application</div>
    <div>
      - Angular requires at least one component and one module. A <i>component</i> is the basic
      building block of Angular applications and acts much like any other HTML element. A
      <i>module</i> is a way for Angular to organize different parts of the application into a single
      unit that Angular can understand. Components are for functionality and structure, whereas
      modules are for packaging and distribution. You might think of components as LEGO bricks,
      which can be many different shapes, sizes, and colors, and modules would be the packaging the LEGOs come in.
    </div>

    <br>

    <li>
      <b>App Component</b>: <br>
      - Look at <code>src/app/app.component.ts</code> in the project. <br>
      -The <code>@Component</code> annotation declares that this class is a component by accepting an
      object. <br>
      - It has a <code>selector</code> property that declares the HTML selector of the component.
      That means the component is used in the template by adding an HTML tag
      <code>&ltapp-root&gt&lt/app-root&gt</code>. Know that with this selector we're defining a new
      HTML <code>tag</code> that we can use in our markup. The <code>selector</code> here indicates <i>which DOM
      element </i> this component is going to use. In this case, any <code>&ltapp-root&gt&lt/app-root&gt</code>
      tags that appear within a template will be compiled using the <code>AppComponent</code> class and get any
      attached functionality. <br>
      - The <code>templateUrl</code> property declares a link to a template containing an HTML template. <br>
      - The <code>styleUrls</code> property contains an array of links to any CSS files that
      should be loaded for this component. <br>
      - The AppComponent class has a single property called <code>title</code>. The
      value is what you should see rendered in the browser, so this is the source of the value
      that ultimately appears.

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">

        </div>
      </div>

      - Now look at <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> in the project. <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">

        </div>
      </div>
      - This is just a simple header tag, but there's the title property defined
      between double curly braces. This is a common convention for how to bind a value into a template. It means
      Angular
      will replace <code>{{title}}</code> with the value of the title property from the component.
      This is called <i>interpolation</i> and is frequently used to display data in a template.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
      <b>App Module</b>: <br>
      - The App module is the packaging that helps tell Angular what's available to render. It also describes the
      various dependencies that are needed to render the module.
      There's at least one module in an application, but it's possible to create multiple modules for different
      reasons<br>
      - The CLI generated the module for us, so we can look at it in <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/c71f0473dd8024737c3f5b5ee5af6d5a.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Just like a component, a module is an object with a decorator. The object here is
      called <code>AppModule</code>, and <code>NgModule</code> is the decorator. <br>
      - The first block is to import any Angular dependencies that are common to most apps and the App component.
      <br>
      - The <code>NgModule</code> decorator takes an object with a few different properties. <br>
      - The <code>declarations</code> property is to provide a list of any components and directives to make
      available
      to the entire application. <br>
      - The <code>imports</code> property is an array of other modules upon which this module depends - in this
      case, the <code>BrowserModule</code>
      (a collection of required capabilities). If you ever include other modules, such as third-party modules or
      ones you've created, they also need to be listed here. <br>
      - The <code>providers</code> property, is empty by default. Any services that are created are to be listed
      here.
      <code>providers</code> is used for dependency injection. So to make a service available to be
      injected throughout our application, we will add it here.<br>
      - The <code>bootstrap</code> property defines which components to bootstrap at runtime. Typically, this will
      be the same App component, and the CLI already set it up for us. <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44316561/why-angular-export-empty-class-in-app-modules-ts">Why
      export an empty class</a> <code>AppModule</code>: The body of the class is indeed empty. But that decorator
      above the class (<code>@NgModule</code>) is giving that class its functionality. So really, that class isn't
      empty. It just doesn't require any extra logic after the decorator is applied to it.
      <code>bootstrapModule</code> takes a class as input and assumes that that class is decorated with <code>@NgModule</code>
      <br>
      - What is the difference between using <code>import</code> to import a class at the top of the file vs using
      <code>imports</code> to add a module: You put something in your <code>NgModule</code> 's imports if you're
      going to be using it in your templates or with dependency injection.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
      <b>Bootstrapping the app</b>: <br>
      - The application must be bootstrapped at runtime to start the process of rendering. <br>
      - Look at <code>angular.json</code> file. One of the properties is the <code>main</code> property. By
      default, it points to the <code>src/app/main.ts</code> file. <br>
      - This means that when the application gets built, it will automatically call the contents of
      the <code>main.ts</code> file as the first set of instructions. <br>
      - The role of main.ts is to bootstrap the Angular application. It is located in:
      <code>src/app/main.ts</code>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b3bb160cdcd82cd9bc167fd07e62dd71.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The <code>platformBrowserDynamic</code> object is used to tell Angular which module is being loading, and
      in this case that's the <code>AppModule</code>. It is important to understand that this is the point where
      the code begins to execute. <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38407604/what-is-angular-platform-browser">This SO Link </a>explains
      why we need the <code>platformBrowserDynamic</code>. Your Angular application can start off in many ways,
      but when you run on the browser you have a specific way of bootstrapping the application and that is defined
      in <code>@angular/platform-browser-dynamic</code>. In short these packages contain angular features which
      make getting an Angular app up and running possible in the browser. Bootstrapping is essential and one of
      those features.<br>
      - You should see the following in the <code>src/index.html</code> file:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/6b8dda863e460873ebce15d73b3ef8ad.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Once the app is bootstrapped by the main.ts code, Angular will look for
      the <code>app-root</code> element and replace it with the rendered component. <br>
      - And thus the sequence of loading the app is complete. The process can be understood as follows: <br>
      - When the application gets built, it automatically calls the contents of <code>main.ts</code>. <code>main.ts</code>
      bootstraps the <code>AppModule</code>. The control passes to the <code>app.module.ts</code> where it sees
      the field <code>bootstrap</code> and figures out which component to use as the first in order to bootstrap
      the application. Control then goes to the <code>app.component.ts</code> class where it sees the <code>templateUrl</code>
      that it has to serve along with the <code>selector</code> <code>app-root</code>.
    </li>

    <div class="sub-heading">Building Services</div>
    <div>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16709882/8742428">SO Link</a> for when to use Services. Services come
      in handy in the following scenarios: <br>
      a) When you want to share information between two or more controllers: <br>
      - One may use <code>$rootScope</code>
      to also communicate between controllers, but it should be avoided as much as possible since it is a global
      scope. <br>
      b) When a functionality is to be used multiple times. <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/36199007/8742428">SO link</a> for how to create a Singleton Service.
      <br>
      - Services are objects that abstract some common logic that you plan to reuse in multiple places. Think of
      services is as sharable objects that any part of your app can import as needed. They can do about anything
      you need them to do, because they're objects. Using ES2015 modules, these classes are exported, and so any
      component can import them as necessary. They could also have functions or even static values, like a string
      or number, as a way to share data between various parts of your application. <br>
      - In the app, you'll want to have a list of the stocks for both the dashboard and manage
      pages to use. This is a perfect scenario of when to use a service to help manage the data
      and share it across different components. <br>
      - To generate a Service you run the following: <code>ng generate service services/stocks</code>.
      The CLI will generate the files in the <code>src/app/services</code> directory. <br>
      - Add the following code to the auto-generated class.

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0b460a32144e8fa69e77b6ee4af7d034.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The <code>StockInterface</code> interface is defined and exported for other components to use. This
      provides a TypeScript definition of what a stock object should contain, which is used by TypeScript to
      ensure the use of the data remains consistent. <br>
      - The <code>StocksService</code> class is exported and is decorated by the <code>Injectable</code>
      decorator. The <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator marks it as a service that can be injected. The
      decorator
      is used to set up the proper wiring for Angular to know how to use it elsewhere, so
      if you forget to include the decorator, the class might not be injectable into your application. <br>
      - In the constructor method, the <code>HttpClient</code> service is injected using the TypeScript
      technique of declaring a private variable called <code>http</code> and then giving it a type of <code>HttpClient</code>.
      <br>
      - The <code>load()</code> method makes a call to the <code>HttpClient</code> service to load the data for
      current stock price values. The <code>HttpClient</code> service is called and returns an observable, which
      is a construct for handling asynchronous events, such as data from an API call. <br>
      - The <code>this.http.get&ltArray&ltStockInterface&gt&gt</code> is the <i>type variable</i>. This is a
      feature of TypeScript that tells it what kind of object it should expect. In this case it will expect
      to get an array of objects that conform to the <code>StockInterface</code>. <br>
      - There is one last thing that we have to do - in the <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> file

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b4f0023fac33831f9ae61231d22e544c.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      Side note about how Dependency Injection works in Angular: <br>
      - There are a few key pieces to the DI system. <br>
      - The first is the <i>injector</i>. This is the service that
      Angular provides for requesting and registering dependencies. You'll invoke the injector by declaring a type
      annotation on the property. This is what we are doing on line 22 of <code>stocks.service.ts</code> file
      above: <code>constructor(private http: HttpClient){ }</code>. Because we declare the type as
      <code>HttpClient</code> (which is a known service in Angular), the application will use the <i>injector</i>
      to ensure that the <code>http</code> property contains an instance of the <code>HttpClient</code> service.
      <br>
      - The second part of DI is <i>providers</i>. Providers are responsible for creating the instance of the
      object requested. The injector knows the list of available providers, and based on the name (which above is
      <code>HttpClient</code>), it calls a factory function from the provider and returns the requested object.
      <br>
      - Anything that has been registered with an <code>NgModule</code>'s <code>providers</code> array is
      available
      to be injected in your application code (hence we add <code>StocksService</code> above in <code>app.module_v2.ts</code>
      to the <code>providers</code> array).


      <br>
      - Now we know how to: <br>
      a) Create a service, make it injectable by using the <code>@Injectable</code> decorator <br>
      b) Import an external Module that your app depends on into your app <br>
      c) Register the service you created with the app so that other components can use it <br>
      Examples of both of these are present in the gist app.module_v2.ts
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Creating your first Component</div>
    <div>
      - Generate a new component by running the following: <code>ng generate component components/summary</code>
      <br>
      - The CLI will generate a new component inside the <code>src/app/components/summary</code> directory. <br>
      - The generated component contains an empty CSS file, basic HTML template, test stub, and empty class
      already initialized with the component annotation.

      - Line 1,2 <code>[ngClass]="{increase:isPositive(), decrease: isNegative()}</code> is a special kind of
      attribute known as a <i>Directive</i>. Directives allow you to modify the behavior and display of DOM
      elements in a template. <code>NgClass</code> directive, for example, allows you to change the list of
      classes that are attached.<br>
      - The <code>NgClass</code> directive is able to add or remove CSS classes to and from the element. It's
      assigned a value, which is an object that contains properties that are the CSS class names (if you go into
      summary.component.css you will see that there are CSS classes with names "increase" and "decrease"), and
      those properties map to a method on the controller (to be written). If the method returns true, it will add
      the class; if false, it
      will be removed. In this snippet, the card will get the <code>increase</code> CSS class when it's positive,
      or the <code>decrease</code> CSS class when it's negative.
      <br>
      <br>
      - Let's move to <code>{{stock?.symbol?.toUpperCase()}}</code>. The double curly braces syntax is the way to
      display some value in the page (interpolation). The content between the braces is called an <i>Angular
      expression</i> and is evaluated against the controller (like the directive), meaning that <i>it will try to
      find a property on the controller to display</i>. If it fails, normally it will throw an error, but the safe
      navigation operator <code>?.</code> will silently fail and not display anything if the property is missing.
      <br>
      <br>
      - <code>{{stock?.lastTradePriceOnly | currency:'USD':'symbol':'.2'}}</code> shows another feature of Angular
      called <i>pipes</i>, which are added directly into the expression to format the output. The interpolation
      expression is extended with a pipe symbol, <code> | </code>, and then a pipe is named and optionally
      configured with values separated with the colon <code> : </code> symbol. Pipes only modify the data before
      it is displayed, and do not change the value in the controller. The double curly braces indicate that you
      want to bind the data stored in the <code>stock.lastTradePriceOnly</code> property to display it. The data
      is piped through the Currency pipe, which converts the value into a financial figure based on a USD figure,
      and rounds to two decimal points.
      <br>
      <br>
      - <code>{{stock?.change | currency:'USD':'symbol':'.2'}} ({{stock?.changeInPercent | percent:'.2'}})</code>
      has two different interpolation bindings with a currency or a Percentage pipe. The first will convert to the
      same currency format, but the second will take a percentage as a decimal, such as 0.06, and turn it into 6%.
      Note that the round brackets in the second interpolation are not the part of any syntax, they are just there
      because the UI needs that value to be in round brackets.

      <br>

      - The <code>summary.component.html</code> template needs a controller to wire up the data and the methods.
      Make the following changes to the <code>src/app/components/summary/summary.component.ts</code> file. <br>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35763730/difference-between-constructor-and-ngoninit">SO
      Link</a> explaining why we need to use <code>ngOnInit</code> if we already have a <code>constructor</code>?
      <br>
      - The summary controller class starts with a property called <code>stock</code>, which is preceded
      with the <code>Input</code> annotation. This indicates that this property is to be provided to the
      component by a parent component passing it to the summary. Properties are bound to
      an element using an attribute, as you can see here - this (hypothetical) example will set the value of
      stockData of the parent component in the stock property of the Summary component:<br>
      <code>&lt;summary [stock]="stockData"&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;</code> <br>
      Because input is passed through a binding attribute, it will evaluate the expression and
      pass it into the <code>stock</code> <code>@Input</code> property for the Summary component to consume. <br>
      - Basically, this is all you need to remember: Angular expressions behave the same anytime there's a
      binding.
      They try to find a corresponding value in the controller to bind to the property. <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45749533/what-is-input-used-for">This SO Link</a> goes into
      why we need the <code>@Input</code> decorator.

      <br>
      <br>
      - We also want to apply certain styling to the summary.
      Open the <code>src/app/components/summary/summary.component.css</code> file. <br>
      - The <code>:host</code> selector is used because we want components to be as self-contained as possible.
      This relies on the Shadow DOM concepts discussed earlier. When Angular renders this component,
      it will modify the output to ensure that the CSS selector is unique and doesn't accidentally interfere with
      other elements on the page. <br>
      - The host selector is a way to specify that you want the styles to apply to the element
      that hosts the element, so in this case it will look at the Summary component element
      itself rather than the contents inside it.

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/169556a4dab7e3f45af12ef35c0409e5.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>
      - Look at the <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> file and you'll see that the CLI already modified
      the module to include the Summary component in the App module. <br>
      - Now update the contents of the <code>src/app/app.component.ts</code> file. <br>
      - We store the loaded stock data onto a property called stocks. We also provide some typing information,
      which is imported from our Stocks service, so that TypeScript knows what kind of value to expect. Finally,
      instead of logging the data to the console, we store it on the stocks property.

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      <br>
      - Now we need to change the <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> file to use the Summary Component. <br>
      - The first line added <code>*ngIf="stocks"</code>, which is a directive that will only render the contents
      inside the element when the expression is true. In this case, it won't render the Summary component until
      the stock data has been loaded. <br>
      - The middle line shows the instantiation of a single Summary component, and the first value of the stocks
      array is bound into the stock property. The data returns as an array, so we're directly accessing the first
      value. Recall the input value we declared in the Summary component, which is also named stock. <br>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>

      - If everything was set up correctly, you should now see your first Component that displays a Summary card
      for the current stock value of AAPL!!!!

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Components that use Components and Services</div>
    <div>
      - Generate another Component: <code>ng generate component components/dashboard</code>. This will output new
      files into the src/app/components/dashboard directory for the HTML, CSS, controller, and unit test. It also
      adds the component to the App module (app.module.ts) to be immediately consumable. <br>
      - Make the following changes to <code> src/app/components/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts</code>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b844691d2db52f978909cdf8dc2c7a0a.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The <code>DashboardComponent</code> class is the component controller, and it declares that it
      must implement the requirements of <code>OnInit</code>. If it doesn't, TypeScript will fail to compile the
      code and throw an error. It then has two properties: an array of stocks and an
      array of strings that represent the stock symbols to display. Initially they're empty arrays,
      so we'll need to get them loaded for the component to render. <br>
      - The <code>constructor</code> method runs as soon as the component is created. It will import
      the Stocks service onto the <code>service</code> property and then request the current list of stock
      symbols from it. This works because this is a synchronous action that loads a value directly from memory.
      <br>
      - But we don't load data from the service in the constructor for a number of reasons. The constructor fires
      early in the rendering of a component, which means that often, values are not yet ready to be consumed.
      Components expose a number of lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute commands at various stages of
      rendering, giving you greater control over when things occur. <br>
      - In our code, we use the <code>ngOnInit</code> lifecycle hook to call the service to load the stock
      data. It uses the list of stock symbols that was loaded in the constructor. We then <code>subscribe</code>
      to wait for the results to return and store them in the stocks property. This uses the observable approach
      to handling asynchronous requests. We are using observables because the <code>HttpClient</code> returns an
      observable for us to receive the response. This is exposed as a stream of data, even though it is
      a single event.

      <br>
      <br>
      - The last step is to change the <code>src/app/components/dashboard/dashboard.component.html</code> file.
      <br>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/1c7c13475c871df7faa086512766d12e.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - We see another element that has a new directive, NgFor. Like NgIf, it starts with
      an <code> * </code> <br>
      - <code>NgFor</code> will then create an instance of the Summary component for each of the stock
      items. It binds the stock data into the component. Each copy of the Summary component is distinct from the
      others, and they don't directly share data.

      <br>
      <br>

      - So now we know how to: <br>
      a) Add a service to a component - inject it into the constructor of the controller class of the
      component<br>
      b) Nest components within other components - in the html file of the parent component, use the
      <code>selector</code> of the child component<br>
      c) Pass data from a parent component to a child component - use attribute binding of type
      <code>[nameOfDataFieldUsedInChildComponent]="nameOfDataFieldUsedInParentComponent"</code>. Remember to
      annotate the nameOfDataFieldUsedInChildComponent in the child component with <code>@Input</code>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Components with forms and events</div>
    <div>
      - Forms are essential in applications, and Angular comes with built-in support for building complex forms
      with many features. Forms in Angular are comprised of any number of <code>controls</code>, which are the
      various types of inputs and fields the form may contain (such as a text input, a checkbox, or some custom
      lement). <br>
      - First, create a new component using <code>ng generate component components/manage</code>. Now update the
      <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> so that it is the <code>app-manage</code> component that is beign
      served. <br>
      - We also need to add the <code>FormsModule</code> to our application, because we are going to use
      the form features that aren't automatically included by Angular. Open up the
      <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> file and add a new import:
      <code>import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';</code> <br>
      - Open <code>src/app/components/manage/manage.component.ts</code> and add the following: <br>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/3fb32efac06faef8811d822865c561db.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The constructor uses the service to get the array of stock symbols and store it on the
      symbols property. This doesn't require the <code>OnInit</code> lifecycle hook, because it's a synchronous
      request to get data that exists in memory.

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/33b47bc2e7bb7cd65fc4f38353f08228.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The <code>(submit)="add()"</code> attribute is a way to add an event listener, known
      as an <code>event binding</code>. When the form is submitted (which is done by pressing Enter), it
      will call the <code>add</code> method. Any attribute that's surrounded by parentheses is an event
      binding, and the name of the event should match the event without the <code> on </code>
      (<code>onsubmit</code>
      is <code>submit</code>). <br>
      - The <code>[(ngModel)]="stock"</code> attribute is a <i>two-way binding</i> that will sync the value of the
      input and the value of the property in the controller anytime it changes from either
      location. This way, as the user types into the text field, the value will be immediately
      available for the controller to consume. When the user hits Enter, the <code>submit</code> event
      fires and will use the value of the stock property when adding the new symbol. <br>
      - The next section loops over the list of symbols using NgFor. For each <code>symbol</code>, it will create
      a local variable called <code>symbol</code>, create a new table row that binds the value, and a button
      that's for removing the item. <br>
      - The <code>remove</code> button contains another event binding, this one to handle the click
      event. The <code>(click)="remove(symbol)"</code> attribute adds an event listener to the click
      event and will call the <code>remove</code> method in the controller, passing along the symbol.
      Because there are multiple instances of the button, each one passes along the local variable to know which
      symbol to remove.

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Application Routing</div>
    <div>
      - <i>Routing</i> configures the different pages that the application can render. Angular has a router that
      works well with the Angular architecture by mapping components to routes. <br>
      - Create a new file at <code>src/app/app.routes.ts</code> <br>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ace5de14640001570352a6f5ff09bc5f.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The router works by declaring an outlet in the template, which is the place in the
      template that the final rendered component will be displayed. Think of the outlet as
      the default placeholder for the content, and until the content is ready to be displayed,
      it will be empty. <br>
      - The <code>RouterModule</code> is used to activate the router and accepts the routes configuration when
      it's initialized. We also import the two routable components, the Dashboard and Manage components, so we
      can reference them properly in our routes configuration. <br>
      - The routes are defined as an array of objects that have at least one property - in this case two, for a
      URL path and a component. For the first route, there's no path, so it acts as the application index (which
      will be http://localhost:4200) and links to the Dashboard component. The second route provides a URL path of
      manage (which will be http://localhost:4200/manage) and links to the Manage component. <br>
      - Finally, we create a new value <code>AppRoutes</code>, which is assigned to the result of
      <code>RouterModule.forRoot(routes)</code>. It's a way to pass configuration to the module. In this case,
      we're passing the array of routes. We export this so we can import it into our App module and register it.
      <br>
      - In <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code>:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/9d9cd4ce9b63faa9a2f2403dc277486f.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - So now we know how to: <br>
      a) Add routing to our app so that when a particular link is clicked, the corresponding
      intended component is rendered.

      <br>
      <br>

      - In the <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> file, make the following changes:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/a80d7f8853c79ce4ff6536492af48aff.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - This declares the specific location in the application that the router should render the
      component. It's the same place that we've put our components while building them, so
      it should make sense that this is the best place. <br>
      - Then we need to update the links to use a new directive that will set up the navigation
      between routes. The RouterLink directive binds to an array of paths that are used to
      build a URL. The directive parses the array and tries to match to a known route. Once it matches a
      route, it will add an href to the anchor tag that correctly links to that route.

    - Install Angular CLI: <code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code> <br>
    - <code>ng</code> will show the available commands that you can run. Had to run this in admin version of Command Prompt. The idea here is that Angular is not just a web
    framework, but rather an entire ecosystem of tools that help you to build web frameworks. <br>
    - If you run into this error when trying to run <code>ng</code> commands: "ng.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system", run the following

    - The Angular Core module allows us to create our own custom html tags (think div, li, etc.). The <code>app-root</code> tag below is not a standard browser element, we have
    created it. We have constructed it using a construct that is known as a Component. A Component allows us to link some style (<code>styleUrls</code>) and html
    (<code>templateUrl</code>), with some typescript logic (interpolation operator: <code>{{ }}</code>). Anything within <code>{{ }}</code> is evaluated as a JS expression within
    the context of the component. <br>
    - <code>@Component</code> is a decorator that identifies the class as an Angular component. <br>
    - Main two takeaways: <br>
    a) The main feature of Angular is the ability of defining our own custom HTML elements (<code>app-root</code>). This allows us to extend the browser functionality with our own
    functionality. <br>
    b) Separation between view and model. The view is the html file, the model is the <code>@Component</code> associated with the html, and the html can access values in the
    component using <code>{{ }}</code>.

    - The <code>app.component.css</code> file defines css rules that are going to be visible only inside the <code>app.component.html</code> page. <br>
    - The angular input property syntax <code>&lt;input [value]="data.courseTitle"&gt;</code> is useful when you want to pass in some data to the template that is available at
    the component class. <br>
    - Another thing that we can do with the Angular Template Syntax is handle browser native events. We do that like this: <br>
    <code>&lt;img (click)="onRocketImageClick()" src="./rocketImage"&gt;</code>. Here, <code>(click)</code> specifies the type of event that we are listening for on the
    <code>img</code> element. The function <code>onRocketImageClick()</code> will have to be added to the component of this html. <br>
    - Another thing that we can do with Angular specific syntax, is to give certain elements of a page, a name. We do this using <code> # </code>. Like so: <br>
    <code>&lt;input [value]="<i>expression</i>" #titleInputBox&gt;</code>. This is called a "Template Reference". We can now use this reference <i>titleInputBox</i> to refer to the
    <code>input</code> element in other parts of the template. The reference can also be injected into the component associated with the html as well. <br>
    - Another thing that Angular does automatically for you is escaping any html/script tags that it encounters in the input. For instance, you are reading text from the
    <code>input</code> box and updating it to reflect on the page using <code>&lt;span&gt;{{ data.courseTitle }} app is running!&lt;/span&gt;</code>. What if an attacker tries to
    input some text that is wrapped inside a <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag? Angular sees that you are using the value input into the input textbox as a plain
    string in your template, and hence will automatically escape any html/script tag that it finds. <br>

    - Like we said before, Angular gives us the ability to create our own custom components. <br>
    - <code>ng generate component <i>component-name</i></code> is the command that we can use for generating our own custom component using the CLI. This will generate the
    following four files: <br>
    a) src/app/course-card/course-card.component.html <br>
    b) src/app/course-card/course-card.component.spec.ts <br>
    c) src/app/course-card/course-card.component.ts <br>
    d) src/app/course-card/course-card.component.css <br>
    - The <code>@Component</code> decorator means that we can use the selector used in that component to create custom html elements of our own.

    - In this section we are going to be looking at how to pass input data into a custom angular compoent using the <code>[]=""</code> and <code>@Input()</code> syntax. <br>
    - In order to be able to use some data in our template (html file), we need to first assign the data to the Component that is associated with the template. <br>
    - In the above image, we saw how we were able to generate multiple cards by just using the <i>app-course-card</i> selector multiple times. Now what we want to do is, we want
    to pass in course-specific data so that each of the cards can show data for different courses. We do this by using the <code>@Input</code> decorator. The idea here is to define
    certain variables, annotated with <code>@Input()</code> on the <i>course-card</i> component, which will be read by the template associated with the component. The parent
    component (in this case, the <i>app.component</i>), will pass the required data to the <i>course-card</i> component through the input property syntax that we saw in Chapter 4
    above.

    </div>
    - Now what about the image and long description? They are also being repeated. One way would be to do the same thing that we did above, and add two more fields annotated with
    <code>@Input()</code> to the <i>course-card</i> component. Alternatively, we can pass in the entire <i>Course</i> object.

  <div id="AngularCore_Chapter8" class="chapter">Chapter 8: Angular Component <code>@Output</code> - Custom Events and Event Emitters</div>
  <hr>

  <div class="textual-content">
    - <a href="https://angular-university.io/lesson/angular-component-outputs">Link to tutorial</a> <br>
    - In this section, we are going to see how we can get the component to emit custom events that can be then handled at the level of the parent component. <br>
    - We want to add a button to each of the course cards such that when the user clicks on the button we can send the user to a page that contains the entire description of the
    course. We add a <code>button</code> input on the <i>course-card</i> template. Then we add a click handler to the button by using the <code>(click)=""</code> syntax. <br>
    - The click event here works as a standard click event, which means that it bubbles outside of the <i>course-card</i> component as well. What this means is that if we add a
    click handler on the <i>app-component</i> to listen for the click event, that event handler will trigger as well. Below is the flow when handling click event which is a browser
    native event.
    <div class="image-block">
      <div class="expand-screenshot-image-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Show Image <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Show Image Button"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="screenshot-image">
        <img src="imgs/AngularDeepDive/Chapter8/OutputWithBrowserNativeEvents.png"
             class="center-block img-fluid"
             alt="OutputWithBrowserNativeEvents">
      </div>
    </div>

    - Using a similar syntax that we've used to handle native browser events, we can also handle custom events (events that we've defined) in the same way. In the below example we
    are going to define a custom event called <i>courseSelected</i>. <br>
    - First we need to emit an event for which we make use of the <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/EventEmitter"><code>EventEmitter</code></a> class from Angular Core. Refer
    the below setup to see how to do this. Note that there is a difference in the way that Angular treats native browser events and custom events. Native events, like the click
    event that we saw above, are automatically bubbled to the parent components. But that is not the case with custom events. Custom events do not automatically bubble to their
    parent components. <br>
    - So the way with how the event handlers are set up right now, you will be getting three different kinds of behavior by clicking the cards. <br>
    a) When you click on the first card's "View Course" button, the click event is triggered which calls <i>handleViewCourseButtonClicked()</i>. The click event then bubbles to the
    parent component, where it is intercepted by the click event listener, and that calls <i>handleCardClick()</i>. The <i>courseSelected</i> event is also fired, but since the
    parent component is not listening for the event, <i>handleCourseSelectedEvent</i> is not called. If you added <code>(courseSelected)="handleCourseSelectedEvent($event)"</code>
    to the first <i>app-course-card</i>, <i>handleCourseSelectedEvent</i> would be called as well. <br>
    b) When you click the second card's "View Course" button, the <i>handleViewCourseButtonClicked()</i> is called. Since we are only listening for the <i>courseSelected</i> event,
    only <i>handleCourseSelectedEvent</i> is called. And <i>handleCardClick()</i> is not called. <br>
    c) When you click the third card's "View Course" button, it is just the <i>handleViewCourseButtonClicked()</i> that is called.

    - <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf"><code>*ngFor</code></a> is a <i>structural directive</i>. A structural directive allows us to change the structure of a page
    based on a javascript expression. <br>
    - In the below example, each course from the <i>Courses</i> array is being exposed as a <i>course</i> which we can then pass into the <i>app-course-card</i> as an input. <br>
    <div class="code-block">

    - <code>*ngFor</code> also gives you some auxiliary features such as <code>index</code>, <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>even</code>, <code>odd</code>. <br>
    - <code>index as i</code> allows us to access the index of the item currently iterating and assign it the name <i>i</i>. <code>first</code> tells us if the element currently in
    iteration is the first element of the collection or not. Same for <code>last</code> as well. <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code> tell us whether the elements are the even or
    odd numbered iterations respectively. <br>
    - You can conditionally add styles to the html. This is done as follows. Note the selector that is being used in the css file to apply the styles. You can read more about
    what is the meaning of the selectors on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">this W3Schools link</a>.

  <div class="textual-content">
    - <a href="https://angular-university.io/lesson/angular-ngif">Link to tutorial</a> <br>
    - <code>ngIf</code> is a directive used for showing/hiding certain parts of the page from the user. <br>
    - The syntax for using <code>ngIf</code> is <code>*ngIf="<i>expression</i>"</code>. If the <i>expression</i> evaluates to <code>true</code>, then the <i>element</i> on which
    the ngIf is being applied will still be present on the screen. If the <i>expression</i> evaluates to <code>false</code>, the element gets hidden. If you "Inspect" the webpage
    at this point, you will see that the element has been completely removed from the DOM. It is not just hidden with CSS. <br>
    - The <i>expression</i> need not necessarily be strictly a boolean. We could pass in an entire object to the <i>expression</i>. If the object was undefined, the
    <i>expression</i> would be evaluated to <code>false</code>, else it would be evaluated to <code>true</code>. You could also add a function call here that would be resolved at
    the level of the component.

      </div>
    </div>

    - Angular also provides us with the Elvis operator <code> ? </code> that allows us to check whether the object is null or not. Consider the below example where the first item
    in the <i>courses</i> array is <code>undefined</code>. This would create a NPE when we try to access <i>course.description</i> or <i>course.iconUrl</i> in the
    <i>course-card.component</i>. We can prevent this by doing <i>course?.iconUrl</i> and <i>course?.description</i>. Instead of having to use suffix every usage of <i>course</i>
    with <code>?</code>, we can instead conditionally show the card depending on whether the course is null or not.

    - Another commonly used feature of <code>*ngIf</code> is the <code>else</code> clause. We saw above how to hide the image when the <i>iconUrl</i> was null. Let's say that
    instead of just hiding the element, we wanted to present some text to the user like "No Image Available". We do this by adding an <code>else</code> clause. The
    <code>else</code> block requires a reference to a template block that is going to contain the message. The template block is created using <code>ng-template</code> and we
    pass it to the <code>else</code> clause by using the template reference <code>#</code> syntax that we have seen before. This is an example of how we do that:
    <div class="image-block">
      <div class="expand-screenshot-image-btn border border-primary rounded">

  <div class="textual-content">
    - <a href="https://angular-university.io/lesson/angular-ngclass">Link to tutorial</a> <br>
    - The <code>ngClass</code> directive is used to conditionally add CSS classes to the template. <br>
    - In the example that we have been following, the <i>courses</i> list has a <i>category</i> field, and one of the values allowed for the field is <i>BEGINNER</i>. We want to
    give cards that show data for beginner courses a different background color. The idea is here is to define a css class <i>beginner</i>, and have Angular conditionally append
    that css class to the <code>class</code> list by using <code>ngClass</code> directive. <br>
    - Using a <code>ngClass="<i>expression</i>"</code> directive allows us to pass an argument that turns on or off certain CSS classes. The <i>expression</i> can take multiple
    kinds of arguments. We can pass it a string, an array, or a configuration object.
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

    </div>

    - Similar to the other directives, we can specify a function that will instead return the configuration object/string/array instead of us having to hard-code the object
    ourselves.

  <hr>

  <div class="textual-content">
    - <a href="https://angular-university.io/lesson/angular-ngstyle">Link to tutorial</a> <br>
    - In the previous lesson we took a look at how to add CSS classes conditionally. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at how to add CSS Styles conditionally. <br>

    - Most of the time we should be able to style our components using plain CSS classes defined directly on the template (for eg. the <i>course-card</i> CSS class that was
    defined on the div above). But there might be situation where we want to apply a style directly to the component. <br>
    - First, let us see how to apply styles directly to an element without using the <code>ngStyle</code> directive. <br>
    - Let's suppose we wanted to underline the title of the course name on each of the course cards. This is how we could do it:
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="code-snippet">

      </div>
    </div>

    - The above examples are just for reference purposes. You should not use <code>ngClass</code> or <code>ngStyle</code> to pass in constant styles to the template. These should
    be used only in cases where the styles themselves are dependent on the data that is coming into the component. For instance, a good usage would be if we wanted to set the
    background image of the cards to the course image that was being returned from the server. In that case we could use the <code>ngStyle</code> to set the background image
    using the <code>background-image: url(<i>course.iconUrl</i>)</code>.

    - We have seen how to conditionally add or remove elements from the page using the <code>ngIf</code> directive. So it offers us just two options. Sometimes, we want more. <br>
    - Suppose we want to add a label element to the card dependent on whether the category is beginner, intermediate, or advanced. <br>
    - The <i>expression</i> passed into the <code>ngSwitch="<i>expression</i>"</code> directive is the expression that we want to switch on, which in this case is going to be
    <i>course.category</i>. We use <code>ngSwitchDefault</code> to handle the default case.

    - In the structural directives that we looked at above (like <code>ngIf</code>, <code>ngSwitch</code>), we had clear parent elements onto which we could apply these directives.
    This is not always the case. We might find ourselves in a situation where we do not have a single parent component onto which we can apply the directive (?). <br>
    - If you ever find yourself in a situation where you don't have a convenient place to apply a structural directive, instead of creating an extra element such as a
    <code>div</code> just for being able to apply the directive, use <code>ng-container</code> instead, because it will not create extra DOM elements.

  <div class="textual-content">
    - <a href="https://angular-university.io/lesson/angular-pipes">Link to tutorial</a> <br>
    - A pipe is a template mechanism that we can use to transform data and display it in another form to the user. <br>
    - Example of Date, String, Number, Currency, Percentage pipes:
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

      </div>
    </div>

    - We also have pipes for handling collections of data. The <code>slice</code> pipe for example allows us to slice arrays similar to how we would do it with the JS
    <code>slice</code> method. In the below example, we are slicing <i>courses</i> array such that we will take the elements from index 0 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive). Hence,
    irrespective of the number of elements in the <i>courses</i> array, our list will contain only 3 elements. Also note that here we are passing in multiple args to the pipe by
    separating them with the <code> : </code> operator.
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

    </div>

    - Some other helpful pipes are the <code>json</code> pipe which will print the entire json object to the page. Another helpful pipe is the <code>keyvalue</code> pipe that
    prints an object as key, value pairs.

    - <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/ViewChild"><code>@ViewChild</code></a> docs. <br>
    - In <a href="#AngularCore_Chapter10">Chapter 10</a> we looked at <code>ng-template</code>, giving it a template reference, and then accessing that element through that
    reference. But sometimes our component (.ts file) needs a reference to the HTML elements defined in the template. For this, we make use of the <code>@ViewChild</code> and
    <code>@ViewChildren</code> decorators. <br>
    - Inside the parentheses of the <code>@ViewChild()</code> decorator, we need to specify how we want to fetch the element. There are multiple ways to do this that you can see in
    the doc link above. In the below example we are using the component type. <br>
    - Note that in the below example we only have one <i>CourseCardComponent</i> that matches the <code>@ViewChild(CourseCardComponent)</code> query. Had there been multiple such
    elements, then the <code>@ViewChild</code> selector would have returned only the very first element that it found.

  <div class="textual-content">
    - <a href="https://angular-university.io/lesson/angular-view-child-2">Link to tutorial</a> <br>
    - Using <code>@ViewChild</code>, we can also query based on a template reference. This is useful in the case when we have multiple components of the same type.
    <div class="image-block">
      <div class="expand-screenshot-image-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Show Image <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Show Image Button"></span>

             alt="ViewChild Using References">
      </div>
    </div>

    - So far we have been using the <code>@ViewChild</code> to inject components. But we can also use this to inject plain HTML elements. <br>
    - The <code>ElementRef</code> type from Angular Core allows us to handle plain native HTML elements. Notice in the below example that when we logged the component, the type
    printed in the console was the component type, i.e. <i>CourseCardComponent</i>. But when we logged the native HTML element, we get the <code>ElementRef</code> type logged
    instead. The <code>ElementRef</code> object contains a property called <code>nativeElement</code> which corresponds to the <i>div.courses</i> element. If you hover over it, the
    div on the html page will get highlighted. Hence, the <code>@ViewChild</code> decorator will give you different behavior depending on whether you are using to query plain DOM
    elements, or if you are querying a component.
    <div class="image-block">
      <div class="expand-screenshot-image-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Show Image <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Show Image Button"></span>
      </div>

             alt="ViewChildRefWithElementRef">
      </div>
    </div>

    - As we saw above, when querying components, we are going to get back the component, and not the HTML element. But we know that each component corresponds to a custom DOM
    element. So suppose if we have a use case where we want to get a reference to the HTML element <i>course-card</i>, and not its component <i>CourseCardComponent</i>. For this,
    we can pass-in a custom object to the <code>@ViewChild()</code> like <code>@ViewChild('cardOneRef', {read: ElementRef})</code>. As we can see in the below example, we are now
    getting the <i>app-course-card</i> for the second card printed on the console.

  <div class="textual-content">
    - <a href="https://angular-university.io/lesson/angular-afterviewinit">Link to tutorial</a> <br>
    - The question we are trying to answer is: when are the variables that are annotated with the <code>@ViewChild</code> annotation populated? <br>
    - In the below example, we have added a constructor to the component, and are logging <i>card1</i> there. When we do that, we see that the reference is logged as
    <i>undefined</i>. This means that the view child ref is not available when the constructor for the component has been called.
    <div class="image-block">
      <div class="expand-screenshot-image-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Show Image <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Show Image Button"></span>

             alt="ViewChild_NotInitInConstructor">
      </div>
    </div>

    - So the question is, when is the earliest moment when we are sure that the references queried by the <code>@ViewChild</code> decorator are already filled in? <br>
    - For this, we need the class to implement a lifecycle hook: <code>AfterViewInit</code>. This will force us to implement the <code>ngAfterViewInit()</code> method. And it is in
    this method where we can earliest access the references populated by the <code>@ViewChild</code> decorator. It is the Angular framework itself that calls this method after the
    references are filled in. Hence, <code>ngAfterViewInit</code> is the place to put some initialization logic that needs access to the <code>@ViewChild</code> elements.
    <div class="image-block">
      <div class="expand-screenshot-image-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Show Image <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Show Image Button"></span>

             class="center-block img-fluid"
             alt="ViewChild_PopulatesInNgAfterViewInit">
      </div>
    </div>

    - When using these kinds of lifecycle hooks, it is important to not modify the data that the component is trying to render. What this means is that, suppose we try to change
    the <i>description</i> of the card in the <code>ngAfterViewInit</code>. This will throw a <code>ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError</code>. Read about the error
    <a href="https://angular.io/errors/NG0100">here on the Angular Site</a>. Also has a video lesson about why this error is caused, and how to fix it. <br>

    <div class="image-block">
      <div class="expand-screenshot-image-btn border border-primary rounded">

             class="center-block img-fluid"
             alt="ngAfterViewInit_exception">
      </div>
    </div>

    - In a nutshell, what happens is this: Angular throws an <code>ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError</code> when an expression value has been changed after change
    detection has completed. Angular only throws this error in development mode. The goal of Change Detection is to keep your model (ts code) in sync with the template (your HTML).
    It does this by looking for data changes in the component tree from top to bottom. The below image is a simplified breakdown of the steps that Angular performs when the
    component is first initialized. Note that the <code>ngAfterViewInit</code> runs after Change Detection. Any code that runs here should not attempt to update the view.
    <div class="image-block">

             alt="AngularSimplifiedLifeCycle">
      </div>
    </div>

    - We also need to understand the scope of the template queries that we are doing. Using <code>@ViewChild</code> annotations, we can query anything at the level of the component
    itself. You cannot query elements that are either in the parent component, or elements that are in the children component either. What this means is that, note in the above
    images that the <i>app.component.html</i> makes use of the <i>app-course-card</i>. The <i>course-card.component</i> makes use of the <i>img</i> tag. If you added a template
    reference to that <i>img</i>, and tried to fetch that image in the <i>app.component.ts</i>, you would get <i>undefined</i>. <br>
    - Hence, the scope of the <code>@ViewChild</code> queries are restricted to the template that is associated with the component in which the decorator is being used.

      teach the browser some new tags, like <code>&lt;login&gt;</code> to display a login bar. This is the basic idea behind components. We are creating components that are
      basically custom tags and teaching the browser how to display them. In the below example, we will be creating our own custom tag:
      <code>app-hello-world</code> <br>
      - We generate a new component by running <code>ng generate component hello-world</code>. This is what the generated component looks like:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e7d7330b8205adc76b36b9fc1c02c330.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Passing values from a Parent Component to a Child Component</div>
    <div>
      - Any property that is defined in a class, can be accessed by the template of the class. Question is, how do we pass the value of that property to a Child component.
      <br>
      - Consider the below code snippet. The property <i>names</i> is declared as an array of strings.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8ff706635a3a7d04d23a7a8afdf232f8.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - We want the child component to use the array of strings. First we tell Angular that we want to pass the data to the child component by doing the below.
      <i>app-user-item</i> is the child component to which we are passing the data. Note that in the assignment operation, <i>name</i> is in quotes. Why are we assigning the
      value to <i>userName</i>? It's because we have defined a property named <i>userName</i> in the <i>app-user-item</i> class.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/833a3525116a2c8f174d2eea692aa888.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - We have defined a property named <i>userName</i> in the <i>app-user-item</i> class. And we are annotating the property with an <code>@Input</code> decorator.
      <code>@Input()</code> allows a parent component to update data in the child component.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/364c61a012cd5cd2e2c55530f9d29f49.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - Any property that is defined in the typescript file can be used in the template using <code>{{ }}</code>. For example, take note of the <i>userName</i> property
      below. The <i>userName</i> property was defined in the file above as a property, and hence we are able to use it below in the template file for the class.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">How is an Angular app bootstrapped</div>
    <div>
      - When you hit <code>ng serve</code>, angular will look for the <code>angular.json</code> file to find the entry point to the app. At a high level, the entire process
      looks like this: <br>
      a) <code>angular.json</code> specifies a <code>main</code> file, which in this case is the <code>main.ts</code> file. <br>
      b) <code>main.ts</code> is the entry point for the application and bootstraps the entire application <br>
      c) The bootstrap process boots an Angular module <br>
      d) The app then goes into <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> where it find the <code>AppModule</code> <br>
      e) <code>AppModule</code> specifies which component to use as the top-level component. In this case it is <code>AppComponent</code> (src/app/app.component.ts) <br>
      f) <code>AppComponent</code>, in its <i>templateUrl</i> then defines the <code>app.component.html</code> which finally contains our <i>app-user-list</i> component <br>
      - Angular has the concept of <i>modules</i>. When you boot an Angular app, you’re not booting a component directly, but instead you create an <code>NgModule</code>
      which points to the component you want to load.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/fd796ae6454e2c34f79051b322d3e549.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - You can see the class annotated with <code>@NgModule</code>. The @NgModule defines four keys that are used. We will look at the keys one-by-one. <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">declarations</p>: specifies the components that are defined in this <i>module</i>. You have to declare components in a NgModule before you can
      use them in your templates. When we use the <code>ng generate</code> to generate a new component, the CLI automatically adds the component to the list of <i>declarations</i>.
      <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">imports</p>: describes which dependencies this module has. Since we are creating a browser app, we have added the dependency as
      <code>BrowserModule</code>.
      Note that there are two similar keywords: <code>import</code> and <code>imports</code>. We put something in our NgModule's imports if we're going to be using it in our
      templates or with dependency injection. <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">providers</p>: providers is used for dependency injection. So to make a service available to be injected throughout our application, we will
      add it here. <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">bootstrap</p>: tells Angular that when this module is used to bootstrap an app, we need to load the <code>AppComponent</code> as the
      top-level component.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Building forms in Angular</div>
    <div>
      - Ideally, a form should be it's own component, but that will make passing data a bit complicated. So instead we are going with a simpler example. <br>
      - This is some version of a form that we will be using:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0f7d3eb0c09c576c8afc734de6edec09.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - We tell Angular we want to respond to an event by enclosing the event name in parentheses. For instance, to add a function call to the <code>&lt;button/&gt;</code>
      <code>onClick</code> event, we do the above. When the button is clicked, it will call the <i>addArticle</i> method. The <i>addArticle</i> method will be defined in the
      same class in which the <code>templateUrl</code> is set as <i>app.component.html</i>. The <i>addArticle</i> function is defined as follows:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/37fa9b235818866792fb469228f0b11d.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - Note that the <i>addArticle</i> method accepts two args. In the html, we need to pass in these values to the <i>addArticle</i> method that is called on the
      <i>onClick</i> event. We do this by using a <i>template variable</i>. Notice that in the input tags we used the # (hash) to tell Angular to assign those tags
      to a local variable. By adding the <i>#newtitle</i> and <i>#newlink</i> to the appropriate <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code> elements, we can pass them as variables into the
      <i>addArticle()</i> function on the button. <br>
      - <code>&lt;input name="title" id="title" #newtitle&gt;</code> this markup tells Angular to <i>bind</i> this <code>input</code> HTML element to the variable <i>#newtitle</i>.
      The <i>#newtitle</i> syntax is called a <i>resolve</i>. <i>newtitle</i> is now an object that represents this input DOM element (specifically, the type is <code>HTMLInputElement</code>).
      Because <i>newtitle</i> is an object, that means we get the value of the input tag using <i>newtitle.value</i>. Similarly we add <i>#newlink</i> to the other
      <code>input</code>
      tag, so that we'll be able to extract the value from it as well. The objects that are returned from the <i>resolve</i> that we used on the input elements are then
      passed into the function <i>addArticle</i>. <br>
      - However, clicking on the 'Submit Link' button will cause the page to reload. JavaScript, by default, propagates the click event to all the parent components. Because
      the click event is propagated to parents, our browser is trying to follow the empty link, which tells the browser to reload (don't know what this means). To fix that,
      we need to make the click event handler to return false. This will ensure the browser won’t try to refresh the page. <br>
      - Hence we update our function which handles the submit functionality to return false when the form is submitted. This tells the browser <i>not</i> to propogate the
      event upwards. Whenever you are using the (click) event, you will have to use the return false if you want to prevent the browser reload. <br>
      - This completes the form. Now when you click on submit, you will be able to see the message logged to the console. <br>
      - We also have something to do with <code>@HostBinding</code> that I do not understand
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

      </div>
      - The below is just to highlight typescript related changes that have been done recently:

  <div class="textual-content">
    <div class="sub-heading">Taking a closer look at Components</div>
    <div>
      - Each Component is composed of three parts: <br>
      a) The Component <code>@Decorator</code> <br>
      b) A <i>View</i> that can be the <code>templateUrl</code> or <code>template</code> <br>
      c) A Controller <br>
      - We looked at this earlier, but repeating it anyways. <br>
      - The <code>@Component</code> is called the Decorator that adds metadata to the class that follows it, which in this case is <code>AppComponent</code>. The
      <code>@Component</code> annotation also specifies the <code>selector</code> which tells Angular which element to match. By saying selector: <i>app-root</i>, we're
      saying that in our HTML we want to match the <i>app-root</i> tag, that is, we’re defining a new tag that has new functionality whenever we use it. E.g. when we put this
      in our HTML: <code>&lt;app-root&gt;</code>, Angular will use the <i>AppComponent</i> component to implement the functionality. <br>
      and specifies <code>template</code> which
      defines the view to render. <br>
      - The Controller is defined by the <code>AppComponent</code> class.

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/9e0dd7282633f2f1b8b71e5f0080b9d2.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Using the <code>{{ }}</code> syntax is called <i>template binding</i>. It tells the view we want to use the value of the expression inside the brackets at this
      location in our template. Note that the code inside the brackets is an <i>expression</i>. What it means is that we can do things like this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e4fe10857b6942267fb3349d8d0d1793.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Handling Inputs and Outputs in Angular</div>
    <div>
      - Consider the following code:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7ca357bc9d61a882afe0da774b60165b.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - The [squareBrackets] pass inputs and the (parentheses) handle outputs. Data flows in to your component via input bindings and events flow out of your component
      through output bindings. <br>
      - <code>[productList]="products"</code> Here we are saying that we want to read the value of the expression 'products' from the AppComponent and store that into the
      productList variable that is defined in the ProductsList component. <i>productList</i> is being referred to in the text as 'attribute key' and <i>products</i> as
      'instance property'. <br>
      - <code>(onProductSelected)="productWasSelected($event)"</code> We're saying that we want to listen to the <i>onProductSelected</i> output from the <i>ProductsList</i>
      component. (onProductSelected), the left-hand side is the name of the output we want to "listen" on. "productWasSelected", the right-hand side is the function we want
      to call when something new is sent to this output. <i>$event</i> is a special variable here that represents the thing emitted on (i.e. sent to) the output. <br>
      - While passing inputs to a child component, we can use different names. i.e. the attribute keys can be different from the instance property names. For example, this is
      how we can pass in the value from the parent component:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/954cef570dad4e681f4725abaca9334e.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - And this is how we can read the values of the input in the Component:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/86da907af74e12a7a6e74d0be174fa0c.js"></script>
