    <div class="sub-heading">Generic Types</div>
    <div>
      - Generics enable <i>types</i> (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. Much like the more familiar <i>formal parameters</i>
      used in method declarations, type parameters provide a way for you to re-use the same code with different inputs. The difference is that the inputs to formal parameters are
      values, while the inputs to type parameters are types. <br>
      - A <i>generic type</i> is a generic class or interface that is parameterized over types. A Generic class is defined in the following format:
      <code>class MyClassName &lt;T1,T2,..,Tn&gt; {/* ... */}</code>. <i>T1</i> to <i>Tn</i> are called the <i>type parameters</i> or the <i>type variables</i>. The type variable
      used in defining the class name can be used anywhere within the class. A type variable can be any <i>non-primitive</i> type you specify: any class type, any interface type,
      any array type(?), or even another type variable(<code>List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>).
      <div class="row">

             class="center-block img-fluid"
             alt="UsingObjectVsGenerics"
             width="850">
      </div>
      - Type parameter naming conventions: E - Element, K - Key, N - Number, T - Type, V - Value, S,U,V etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types. <br><br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Some commonly used terms</p>: <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">Type Parameter and Type Argument</p>: Many developers use the terms "type parameter" and "type argument" interchangeably, but these terms are not
      the same. When coding, we provide type arguments in order to create a parameterized type. Therefore, the <code>T</code> in <code>Foo&lt;T&gt;</code> is a type parameter and
      the String in <code>Foo&lt;String&gt;</code> is a type argument. This lesson observes this definition when using these terms. <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">Generic Type Invocation</p>: To reference the generic <i>Box</i> class from within your code, you must perform a generic type invocation, which
      replaces T with some concrete
      value, such as Integer. <code>Box&lt;Integer&gt; integerBox</code> is an example of this. Similar to how you would pass an argument to a method invocation, you pass a
      <i>type argument</i>, Integer in this case, to the <i>Box</i> class itself. An invocation of a generic type is known as a <i>parameterized type</i>. <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">Raw Types</p>: Using a generic class or interface without using type arguments is a raw type. For instance, doing <code>Box box = new Box();</code>
      is a raw usage of <i>Box&lt;T&gt;</i>. In this case, <i>box</i> would just be a <i>box of <code>Object</code>s</i>. <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Generic Methods</div>
    <div>
      - Generic methods are methods that introduce their own type parameters. This is similar to declaring a generic type, but the type parameter's scope is limited to the method
      where it is declared. Static and non-static generic methods are allowed, as well as generic class constructors. <br>
      - When calling the method in the <i>Test</i> class we have explicitly called the passed the types. This is not necessary and the compiler can mostly determine the types on
      its own. This is known as <i>type inference</i>.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Bounded Type Parameters</div>
    <div>
      - There may be times when you want to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments in a parameterized type. For example, a method that operates on numbers might only
      want to accept instances of <code>Number</code> or its subclasses. This is what <i>bounded type parameters</i> are for. <br>

      - Question: How is this any different from just using a method with an argument of type <code>Number</code>? <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
      - The above examples have shown how to use types with a single bound. But you can also combine the bounds to have types with <i>multiple bounds</i>. <br>
      - Example: <code>class MyClassName &lt;T extends T1 & T2 & T3&gt;</code> <br>
      - A type variable with multiple bounds is a subtype of all the types listed in the bound. If one of the type is a class, it must be specified first. Example: <br>
      <code>class A {/* ... */}</code> <br>
      <code>interface B {/* ... */}</code> <br>
      <code>interface C {/* ... */}</code> <br>
      and consider a class that uses all 3 of the bounds as: <br>
      <code>class D &lt;T extends A & B & C&gt {/* ... */};</code> <br>
      If bound A is not specified as the first bound then you get a compile error. Remember that you can only extend from one class. Hence there will only be one class present in
      the type parameter declaration and that class type declaration should be the first one. Read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30343300/8742428">this SO answer </a> for
      more detail. <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Generic Methods and Bounded Type Parameters</div>
    <div>
      - Bounded type parameters are the key to the implementation of generic algorithms. Consider the following two attempts at creating a generic algorithm:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">How do Inheritance and SubTypes work in the case of Generics?</div>
    <div>
      - The primary thing that you have to keep in mind is that although <code>Integer</code> is a subtype of <code>Number</code>, <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is not a
      subtype of <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>. The below code snippet provides an example of this:

      - <a href="http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/ProgrammingIdioms.html#FAQ302">Angelika Langer FAQs about Generics</a> <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5730929/java-generics-are-these-two-method-declarations-equivalent/5731463#5731463">This SO post answers</a> the doubt
      you had about why we would use <code>public &lt;T extends SomeBaseClass&gt; void myMethod(Class&lt;T&gt; clz)</code> vs
      <code>public void myMethod(Class&lt;? extends SomeBaseClass&gt; clz)</code>
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">What is the Problem that we are trying to solve?</div>
    <div>
      - Consider the following:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d5ada1e8ea67a8662a5d5bd586d31f28.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - We want to avoid this problem. We want Java to 'know' that we intend to use the instance of <code>ObjectWrapper</code> with String, and want Java to pre-emptively
      warn us
      when we try to use it with <code>Integer</code> type. <br>
      - Generics lets you specify a <i>type parameter</i> with a type (class or interface). Such a type is called a generic type (more specifically generic class or generic
      interface).
      The <i>type parameter value</i> could be specified when you declare a variable of the generic type and create an object of your generic type. If you have difficulty
      visualizing it, just replace the <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> with <code>String</code> instead.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/aaf442d3fef787b7b98304bd5b82481c.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - The parameter that is specified in the type declaration is called a <i>formal type parameter</i>; for example, <code> T </code> is a formal type parameter in the
      <i>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;</i> class declaration. When you replace the formal type parameter with the actual type (e.g. in Wrapper&lt;String&gt; you replace the formal type
      parameter <code> T </code> with <code>String</code>), it is called a <i>parameterized type</i>. A reference type in Java, which accepts one or more type parameters, is
      called a generic type. <br>
      - A generic type is mostly implemented in the compiler. The JVM has no knowledge of a generic type. All actual type parameters are erased during compile time using a
      process known as <i>erasure</i>. Compile-time type-safety is the benefit that you get when you use a parameterized generic type in your code without the need to use
      casts.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Supertype-Subtype Relationship</div>
    <div>
      - Note that <code>Wrapper&lt;String&gt;</code> is not assignment compatible to <code>Wrapper&lt;Object&gt;</code>. <br>
      - In the below example, if you were able to assign as reference of <i>strWrapper</i> to <i>objWrapper</i>, the compiler would not be able to make sure that the
      <i>strWrapper</i> will store only a reference of a String type. <br>
      - Remember that a <code>String</code> is an <code>Object</code> because <code>String</code> is a subclass of <code>Object</code>. However,
      <code>Wrapper&lt;String&gt;</code> is not a <code>Wrapper&lt;Object&gt;</code>. The normal supertype/subtype rules do not apply with parameterized types.

    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Raw Type</div>
    <div>
      - The code may use (though it is not recommended) a non-generic version of a generic class by just omitting references to the generic type parameters. The non-generic
      version of a generic type is called a <i>raw type</i>. Using raw types is discouraged. If you use raw types in your code, the compiler will generate unchecked warnings.

    <div class="sub-heading">Unbounded Wildcards</div>
    <div>
      - Suppose we want to print the details of the <i>Wrapper</i> class for which we create a method. What should be the args that should be input into the method. This is
      the first version of the solution. Since the <i>printDetails()</i> method is supposed to print details about a <i>Wrapper</i> of any type, <code>Object</code> as
      parameter type seemed to be more suitable. (Not using <code> T </code> as a parameter type right now. Probably come back to that later.)
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>
      - As you can see the above code generates a compile-time error. We already looked at why this error is generated, it's because <code>Wrapper&lt;String&gt;</code> and
      <code>Wrapper&lt;Object&gt;</code> are not assignment compatible. <br>
      - This is the problem that wildcards allows us to solve. <br>
      - A wildcard type is denoted by a question mark, as in <code> &lt;?&gt; </code>. Think about how you can assign a reference of any type to a reference of an
      <code>Object</code> type. In the same way, you can assign generic of any type to a generic of a wildcard type. <br>
      - The question mark in a wildcard generic type (e.g., &lt;?&gt;) denotes an <i>unknown type</i>. When you declare a parameterized type using a wildcard (means unknown)
      as a parameter type, it means that it does not know about its type. <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/9181cc0af907c6e99d00f462ed3f3944.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - There is a complicated list of rules as to what a wildcard generic type reference can do with the object. However, there is a simple rule of thumb to remember. The
      purpose of using generics is to have compile-time type-safety in Java programs. As long as the compiler is satisfied that the operation will not produce any surprising
      results at runtime, it will allow the operation on the wildcard generic type reference. <br>
      - I think what you basically have to wrap your head around is this: The class <i>Wrapper</i> is defined as <i>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;</i>. Whenever you will instantiate the
      <i>Wrapper</i> class, you will do it like this for example: <i>Wrapper&lt;String&gt;</i>. So the compiler will know that you intend to use this class with a
      <code>String</code>
      type. The <i>getRef</i> and the <i>setRef</i> methods in the class make use of the <code>T</code> parameter either as argument to a function, or as a return type.
      Once you have made it clear that <code>T</code> is in fact <code>String</code> (by instantiating the <i>Wrapper</i> class with <i>Wrapper&lt;String&gt;</i>, you are
      essentially telling the compiler that you intend to use the <i>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;</i> class as a <i>Wrapper&lt;String&gt;</i> class. Hence the compiler can go ahead and
      replace all occurrences of <code>T</code> with <code>String</code>) the compiler can then kick-in and perform all the necessary checks it needs to do to
      make sure that there are no surprises during run-time. <br>
      - But then, you can also instantiate the class as <i>Wrapper&lt;?&gt;</i>. Now you are telling the compiler that you <i>don't</i> know what the type of argument or the
      return type of the methods in this class are going to be. So if you use something like <code>String str = unknownWrapper.getRef();</code>, the compiler is going to
      complain and say: <br>
      - Hey you never said that the <i>getRef</i> method is supposed to return just <code>String</code>. What if you created a wrapper class with something like this:
      <code>Wrapper<?> unknownWrapper = new Wrapper<>(1234);</code>. Then what am I supposed to do at this line of code: <code>String str = unknownWrapper.getRef();</code> I
      am going to show you a compile error so that you know that is not right. If you do this <code>String str = (String) unknownWrapper.getRef();</code>, I will no longer
      show you the compile error, but you are still going to get a <code>ClassCastException</code> at runtime. All I know is that the <i>getRef</i> is going to return an
      unknown type, and that unknown type is going to be atleast an <code>Object</code>. So the best you can do is write <code>Object obj = unknownWrapper.getRef();</code>.
      <br>
      - Now why do I show compile errors when you are trying to use <i>setRef</i>? <br>
      - Why does the <i>setRef(new Object())</i> method generate a compile-error as well? Field&lt;?&gt; means Field&lt;? extends Object&gt; and when you have
      <i>? extends Something</i> you can only <i>get</i> values out of it, you can't <i>set</i> values in it except <code>null</code> (<a

    <div class="sub-heading">Upper-Bounded Wildcards</div>
    <div>
      - The upper bound of a wildcard is expressed as <code>&lt;? extends T&gt;</code>. Here <code>T</code> is a type. <code>&lt;? extends T&gt;</code> means anything that
      is of type <code>T</code> or its subclass is acceptable. For example <code>Number</code> is a type, and <code>Integer</code>, <code>Double</code> are its subclasses.
      Hence if we want the args to be only of type <code>Number</code> or one of its subclasses, we write <code>Wrapper&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code> <br>
      - Suppose the problem was to add two numbers. The first solution that you could come up with could look like this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      - Finding the sum of an <code>Integer</code> and a <code>String</code> obviously does not make any sense. But the code still compiles, and will generate errors only
      during runtime. Hence we want to restrict both of the args to be a <code>Number</code> or a subclass of a <code>Number</code>. Hence we know the <i>upper-bound</i> of
      the type of the actual parameter that the <i>Wrapper</i> object should have. (It's <i>upper-bound</i> because recall that in the inheritance tree, the super class is
      higher and the subclass is lower in the tree with the subclass having a directed arrow <i>to</i> the superclass. Hence <code>Number</code> is an upper bound). <br>
      - Hence we rewrite the code as:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

      - Note the following code snippet:

    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Lower-Bounded Wildcards</div>
    <div>
      - The lower bound of a wildcard is expressed as <code>&lt;? super T&gt;</code>. This means "anything that is of type <code>T</code> or is a supertype of <code>T</code>
      is acceptable". <br>
      - Let us first take a look at the wrong way of doing it. The below code will generate a compile-time error because the copy() method requires the source and the dest
      arguments be of the same type. See how one version of the <i>copy_v1()</i> method compiles properly while the other one doesn't? Asked a question about it <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68463043/generics-in-java-does-not-compile">here on SO.</a>.

        </div>
      </div>
      - So what does the right way look like? For all practical purposes a String is always an Object. Here, you need to use a lower-bounded wildcard.
      <div class="code-block">

    <div class="sub-heading">Generic Methods and Constructors</div>
    <div>
      - You can define type parameters in a method declaration. They are specified in angle brackets before the return type of the method. The type that contains the generic
      method declaration does not have to be a generic type.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

      </div>
      - You can use the type parameter specified for the generic type inside the non-static method declaration. The new type parameter <code>V</code> forces the first and the
      second arguments of method m1() to be of the same type. The third argument must be of the same type <code>T</code>, which is the type of the class instantiation.

    <div id="recursive-type-params" class="sub-heading">What is recursive type parameter in Generics? And why is it used?</div>
    <div>
      - Excellent answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/64901718/8742428">here on SO.</a> <br>
      - Assume that we have to sort the fruits by their sizes. And we are told that we can only compare fruits of the same types. For example, we can't compare apples with
      oranges.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/9c2da6b8ed0d54fbe292faf2638fa748.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - So what is the problem with the above solution? The problem here is that the code for implementing the <code>compareTo()</code> method is duplicated for Apple and
      Orange class. And will be duplicated more in all the classes that we extend from the Fruit, for creating new fruits in the future. The amount of repeated code in our
      example is less but in real world the repeated code can be of hundreds of lines in each class. <br>
      - So we come up with the following solution. In this step, we get rid of the repeated code of <code>compareTo()</code> method by moving it to a superclass. Our extended
      classes Apple and Orange are no longer polluted with common code. But now the problem is that we are now able to compare different types, comparing apples to oranges no
      longer gives us an error.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/2f1b41e795dcafbdedab94ea16d392ec.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - So we try a different approach where we try to introduce a type parameter. To restrict comparison of different types, we introduce a type parameter <code>T</code>. So
      that the comparable <i>Fruit&lt;Apple&gt;</i> cannot be compared to comparable <i>Fruit&lt;Orange&gt;</i>. Note our Apple and Orange classes; they now inherit from the
      types <i>Fruit&lt;Apple&gt;</i> and <i>Fruit&lt;Orange&gt;</i> respectively. Now if we try to compare different types, the IDE shows an error, which is our desired
      behaviour. But in this step, our <i>Fruit</i> class doesn't compile. The <i>getSize()</i> method of <code>T</code> is unknown to the compiler. This is because the type
      parameter <code>T</code> of our <i>Fruit</i> class doesn't have any bound. So, the <code>T</code> could be any class, it is not possible that every class would have a
      <i>getSize()</i> method. So the compiler is right in not recognizing the <i>getSize()</i> method of <code>T</code>.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/f7dbe01a569c04c360f254c522d9c51b.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - So to solve this problem, we finally introduce the Recursive Type Parameter. So, we tell the compiler that our <code>T</code> is a subtype of Fruit. In other words,
      we specify the upper bound <code>T extends Fruit&lt;T&gt;</code>. This makes sure that only subtypes of Fruit are allowed as type arguments. Now the compiler knows that
      the <i>getSize()</i> method can be found in the subtype of Fruit class (Apple, Orange etc.) because the <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code> also receives our type
      (<code>Fruit&lt;T&gt;</code>) that contains the <i>getSize()</i> method. This allows us to get rid of the repeated code of <code>compareTo()</code> method and also
      allows us to
      compare the fruits of the same types, apples with apples and oranges with oranges.

    <div class="sub-heading">"New" features introduced in Java</div>
    <div>
      - These are some of the features we will be looking at in this chapter: <br>
      a) Generics <br>
      b) Boxing and Unboxing <br>
      c) For-Each <br>
      d) Generic methods and variables
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Generics</div>
    <div>
      - An interface or a class can be declared to take one or more <i>type parameters</i>. These are written in angle brackets. These parameters need to be supplied when you
      declare a variable belonging to the class, or when you create a new instance of the class. <br>
      - Consider the following example of code using generics vs using raw usage. Without generics, the type parameters are omitted, but you must explicitly cast whenever an
      element is extracted from the list.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/cd1524a6e72162879fc86975b08fb224.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - In fact, the bytecode compiled from the two sources above will be identical. We say that generics are implemented by <i>erasure</i>, because the types
      <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>, and <code>List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> are all represented at runtime by the same type -
      <code>List</code>. We also use <i>erasure</i> to describe the process that converts the first program to the second program. <br>
      - Note that this is not how it is implemented in other languages, as mentioned in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/879914/8742428">SO answer here</a>. .NET generics
      actually create new types - a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> in C# is a different type than a <code>List&lt;Int&gt;</code> . In Java, under the covers, they are the same
      thing.
      - a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>. This means that if you have one of each, you can't look at them at runtime and see what they were declared as - only what they are now.
      <br>
      - The term <i>erasure</i> is a slight misnomer (a wrong or inaccurate use of a name or term) because although the process erases type parameters, it introduces casts. Hence,
      generics implicitly performs the same cast that is done explicitly when we are not using generics. The guarantee is that the implicit casts added by generics never fail. The
      fine-print on the guarantee is that it applies only when no <i>unchecked warnings</i> have been issued by the compiler (?). <br>
      - A consequence of implementing generics by erasure is that array types differ in key ways from its parameterized types. Executing <code>new String[<i>size</i>]</code>
      allocates an array, and stores in that array an indication that it's components are of type <code>String</code>. (Note that here they are talking about storing the type in
      the byte-code/code available during runtime rather than the code at compile time). In contrast, executing <code>new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()</code> allocates a list, but
      does not store in the list any indication of the type of its elements. In the jargon we say that, Java <i>reifies</i> array component types but does not reify list element
      types (or other generic types). <br>
      - Also note that type parameters can only be bound to reference types, and not to primitive types. What this means is that you can declare a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>
      but not of <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code>.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Boxing and Unboxing</div>
    <div>
      - Every type in java is either a <i>reference</i> type or a <i>primitive</i> type. A reference type is any class, interface, or array type. All reference types are subtypes
      of class <code>Object</code>, and any variable of the reference type can be set to <code>null</code>. All eight primitive types in java have corresponding class of a
      reference type. <br>
      - Conversion of a primitive type to the corresponding reference type is called <i>boxing</i> and conversion of the reference type to the corresponding primitive type is
      called <i>unboxing</i>. <br>
      - One subtlety of boxing and unboxing is that <code> == </code> is defined differently on primitive and reference types. On type <code>int</code>, it is defined by the
      equality of values, and on type <code>Integer</code>, it is defined by object identity. <br>
      - Consider the following example:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/2132abcc2e381380ce5db426dab1556f.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Another subtlety to keep in mind is that boxed values can be cached. Caching is required when boxing an <code>int</code> or <code>short</code> between -128 and 127, a
      <code>char</code> value between <code>'\u0000'</code> and <code>'\u007f'</code>, a <code>byte</code>, or a <code>boolean</code>. <br>
      - This leads to the following scenario. Taking the same code example as above, we now calculate the sum of 1,2,3,4. We compare the results using the
      <i>calculateIntegerSum</i>, but now we see that it prints that the two results are equal, as opposed to the above case where we got the result as false. This is because 10 is
      smaller than 128, so boxing the value 10 always returns exactly the same object. In general, it is not specified whether boxing the same value twice should return identical
      or distinct objects, so the inequality assertion shown earlier may either fail or succeed depending on the implementation.

      - Here is a method that accepts an <code>array</code> of any type and converts it into a <code>List</code>. The method <i>convertArraysToList</i> accepts an array of type
      <code>T[]</code> and returns a list of type <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, and does so for <i>any</i> type <code> T </code>. This is indicated by writing <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>
      at the beginning of the method signature, which declares <code> T </code> as a new type variable. A method which declares a type variable in this way is called a <i>generic
      method</i>. The scope of the type variable <code> T </code> is local to the method itself. <code> T </code> may appear in the method signature and the method body, but not
      outside the method.

    <div class="sub-heading">Subtyping</div>
    <div>
      - In java, one type is a <i>subtype</i> of another if they are related by an <code>implements</code> or <code>extends</code> clause. Here are some examples. The presence of
      the <i>same</i> type parameter <code>E</code> in the below examples means that the relations hold only if the <i>same</i> type parameters are used in both lhs and rhs of a
      row. So if the <code>E</code> on the rhs is <code>Number</code>, the <code>E</code> on the lhs HAS to be <code>Number</code> as well. It cannot be <code>Integer</code> or
      <code>Double</code>.
      <table class="table table-bordered table-sm">
        <!--        <thead>-->
        <!--        <tr>-->
        <!--          <th><p>Value</p></th>-->
        <!--          <th><p>Description</p></th>-->
        <!--          <th><p>Description</p></th>-->
        <!--        </tr>-->
        <!--        </thead>-->
        <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Integer</code></td>
          <td>is a subtype of</td>
          <td><code>Number</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Double</code></td>
          <td>is a subtype of</td>

        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>List&lt;E&gt;</code></td>
          <td>is a subtype of</td>
          <td><code>Collection&lt;E&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>is a subtype of</td>
          <td><code>Iterable&lt;E&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      - But also note that:
      <table class="table table-bordered table-sm">
        <!--        <thead>-->

        <!--          <th><p>Description</p></th>-->
        <!--        </tr>-->
        <!--        </thead>-->
        <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code></td>
          <td>is NOT a subtype of</td>
          <td><code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code></td>
          <td>IS a subtype of</td>
          <td><code>List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code></td>
          <td>IS a subtype of</td>
          <td><code>List&lt;? super Number&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Integer[]</code></td>
          <td>IS a subtype of</td>
          <td><code>Number[]</code></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      - Subtyping is transitive, meaning that if one type is a subtype of a second, and the second is a subtype of a third, then the first is a subtype of the third. What this
      means is, <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>Collection&lt;E&gt;</code>, <code>Collection&lt;E&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>Iterable&lt;E&gt;</code>, hence
      <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>Iterable&lt;E&gt;</code>. <br>
      - If one type is a subtype of another, we also say that the second is a <i>supertype</i> of the first. <br>
      - Every reference type is a subtype of <code>Object</code>, and <code>Object</code> is a supertype of every reference type. We also say, trivially, that every type is a
      subtype of itself.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Substitution principle</div>
    <div>
      - A variable of a given type may be assigned a value of any subtype of that type, and a method with a parameter of a given type may be invoked with an argument of any subtype
      of that type. What this means is that wherever a value of one type is expected, we can provide a value of any subtype of that type. <br>
      - Take the <code>Collection</code> class for example which has a method <code>add</code> which takes a parameter of type <code>E</code>. The substitution principle says that
      if we have a <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>, we can add a <code>Decimal</code> or an <code>Integer</code> to it. This is because <code>Decimal</code> and
      <code>Integer</code> are subtypes of <code>Number</code>.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ab8bf2630919ace64f32ad84fc8c8816.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Like we mentioned in the table above, it may seem reasonable to expect that since <code>Integer</code> is a subtype of <code>Number</code>, it follows that
      <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>. But this is NOT the case. Consider the following example. For the same reason, we cannot
      consider <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code> to be a subtype of <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> either.
      <div id="code-example-Ch2substitution" class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/1e915b63017ba8efe43e20a26f5f4756.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - So <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is not a subtype of <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>, nor is <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code> a subtype of
      <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>; all we have is the trivial case, where <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is a subtype of itself, and we also have that
      <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>Collection&lt;Integer&gt;</code>. <br>
      - Arrays behave quite differently though. An <code>Integer[]</code> IS a subtype of <code>Number[]</code>. <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Wildcard with <code>extends</code></div>
    <div>
      - Another member in the <code>Collection</code> interface is <code>addAll</code>. It adds all the members of one collection to another collection. This is what the method
      on the interface looks like:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/74f4c3680e020cce792e08089b9ec1f2.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Clearly, given a collection of type <code>E</code>, it is ok to add another collection with elements of type <code>E</code>. <br>
      - The quizzical phrase <code>? extends E</code> means that it is also OK to add all members of a collection with elements of any type that is a <i>subtype</i> of
      <code>E</code>. The <code>?</code> is called a <i>wildcard</i>, since it stands for <i>some</i> type that is a <i>subtype</i> of <code>E</code>. If the method signature for
      <code>addAll</code> had been written without the wildcard, then the calls to add lists of integers and doubles to a list of numbers would not have been permitted; you would
      only have been able to add a list that was explicitly declared to be a list of numbers.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e77078ad2847906cd1da7fcd53d8a3b4.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - We can also use wildcards when declaring variables. Consider the below example. Note the line that is now producing the compile error. It is different from the line that
      was producing the compile error in the <a href="#code-example-Ch2substitution">substitution code example we saw earlier</a>. Earlier, it was the fourth line that was throwing
      the error, because <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> could not be assigned to <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>. And the fifth line was fine, since 3.14 is of type
      <code>Double</code>, we could add it to a <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>. However, now the fourth line is fine because <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is a subtype of
      <code>List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code>, but the fifth line causes a compile error, because you cannot add a <code>Double</code> to a
      <code>List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code>, <i>since it might be a list of some other subtype of </i> <code>Number</code>. Because, similar to the argument we made during the
      substitution example, if the line that is producing the compile error actually compiled, then we would have ended up adding a <code>double</code> value to
      <i>extendedNumber</i> which is actually pointing to the same reference of the <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code> <i>integers</i>, and hence we would have added a
      <code>double</code> to a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, and that would have created a black hole. <br>
      - In general, if a structure contains elements with a type of the form <code>? extends E</code>, we can get elements out of the structure, but we cannot put elements into the
      structure. To put elements <i>into</i> a structure we need another kind of wildcard, that we are going to see in the next section.

    <div class="sub-heading">Wildcard with <code>super</code></div>
    <div>
      - Here is a method that copies into a destination list, elements of all the elements of the source. <br>
      - The quizzical phrase <code>? super T</code> means that the destination list may have elements of any type that is a <i>supertype</i> of <code>T</code>, just as the source
      list may have elements of any type that is a <i>subtype</i> of <code>T</code>. <br>

      </div>

      - The method <i>copy</i> itself could have been declared with several different possible signatures:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">The Get and Put Principle</div>
    <div>
      - It may be good practice to insert wildcards whenever possible, but how do you decide <i>which</i> wildcard to use? Where should you use <code>extends</code>, where should
      you use <code>super</code>, and where is it inappropriate to use a wildcard at all? We use the <i>Get and Put</i> principle to determine which is appropriate. <br>
      - The principle states that: use an <code>extends</code> wildcard when you only <i>get</i> values out of a structure, use a <code>super</code> wildcard when you only
      <i>put</i> values into a structure, and don't use a wildcard when you <i>both</i> get and put. <br>
      - We already saw this principle at work in the signature of the <i>copy</i> method above. The method <i>gets</i> value out of the source <i>source</i>, so it is declared with
      an <code>extends</code> wildcard. And it <i>puts</i> values into the destination <i>destination</i>, hence it is declared with the <code>super</code> wildcard.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/4cf04451d0aa794ba5daa93bf2ead813.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - When you use an iterator over a collection, you are effectively getting values out of a structure. Hence you use an <code>extends</code> wildcard. For example, here is a
      method that takes a collection of numbers, converts each into a <code>double</code>, sums them up and returns the answer in the form of a <code>double</code>. Here we are
      looking at the case when we are not using the <code>? extends Number</code> in the parameter of the method. Hence we can only call the method with
      <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>. The others generate compile error. This should not surprise you any more.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7c0617e7462fb5dee5c23c364207f3a3.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Now when we actually use the <code>? extends Number</code> in the method declaration, we can pass in <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;Double&gt;</code>
      as well.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      - On the other side, whenever we use the <code>add</code> method on a collection, we <i>put</i> values into a structure, so we use a <code>super</code> wildcard. Here is a
      method that takes a collection of <code>Integer</code>s, an integer <i>n</i>, and puts the numbers from 1 to n into the collection. We start with the method declaration not
      having <code>? super Integer</code> in the method declaration. As expected, compile fails when trying to call the <i>count</i> method with anything other than
      <code>Collection&lt;Integer&gt;</code>.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/c69e16f9a9bef6c9842fdfea5b415bd9.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Now we add <code>? super Integer</code> to the method declaration. Again as expected, all the three method calls now compile.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      - Whenever you both <i>put</i> values into and <i>get</i> values out of the <i>same</i> structure, you should not use a wildcard. In the following example, the collection is
      passed to <i>both</i> <i>sum</i> and <i>count</i>. Hence, the type parameter should <code>Collection&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code> and
      <code>Collection&lt;? super Integer&gt;</code>. Hence the method declaration can only be either <code>Collection&lt;Number&gt;</code> or
      <code>Collection&lt;Integer&gt;</code>. We went with <code>Collection&lt;Number&gt;</code>. Since there is no wildcard, the argument must be a collection of
      <code>Number</code>.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/5eda0c40aabd5c13c3750fc1d5546d88.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The Get and Put Principle also works the other way around. If an <code>extends</code> wildcard is present, pretty much all you will be able to do is get but not put values
      of that type; and if a <code>super</code> wildcard is present, pretty much all you will be able to do is put but not get values of that type.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>

      - Each of the rules in the Get and Put principle have one exception to each of them. <br>
      - You cannot put anything into a type declared with an <code>extends</code> wildcard - except for the value <code>null</code>, which belongs to every reference type. <br>
      - Similarly, you cannot get anything out from a type declared with a <code>super</code> wildcard - except for a value of type <code>Object</code>, which is a supertype of
      every reference type. <br>
      - You may find it helpful to think of <code>? extends T</code> as containing every type in an interval bounded by the type of <code>null</code> below and by <code>T</code>
      above (where the type of <code>null</code> is a subtype of every reference type). Similarly, you may think of <code>? super T</code> as containing every type in an interval
      bounded by <code>T</code> below and by <code>Object</code> above.

      - It is tempting to think that an <code>extends</code> wildcard ensures immutability, but it does not. As we saw earlier, given a list of type
      <code>List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code>, you may still add <code>null</code> values to the list. You may also remove list elements (using <code>remove</code>,
      <code>removeAll</code>, or <code>retainAll</code>) or permute the list (using <code>swap</code>, <code>sort</code>, or <code>shuffle</code> in the convenience class
      Collections). If you want to ensure that a list cannot be changed, use the method <code>unmodifiableList</code> in the class Collection.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Arrays</div>
    <div>
      - In Java, array subtyping is <i>covariant</i>, meaning that type <code>S[]</code> is considered to be a subtype of <code>T[]</code> whenever <code>S</code> is a subtype of
      <code>T</code>. <br>
      - The below example compiles without any errors. It is only when you try to run the program that you get a <code>ArrayStoreException</code>. So what causes the error? <br>
      - When an array is allocated (as on the first line), it is tagged with its <i>reified type</i> (a run-time representation of its component type, in this case,
      <code>Integer</code>). And every time an array is assigned into (as on the third line), an array store exception is raised if the reified type is not compatible with the
      assigned value (in this case, a <code>double</code> cannot be stored into an array of <code>Integer</code>).
      <div class="code-block">

        </div>
      </div>

      - In contrast, the subtyping relation for generics is invariant, meaning that type <code>List&lt;S&gt;</code> is not considered to be a subtype of <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>,
      except in the trivial case where <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> are identical. We have seen this already, here is the above example, but now using a <code>List</code>.
      Hence, while using <code>List</code> we are able to detect the problem at compile-time itself.

      - Wildcards reintroduce covariant subtyping for generics, in that type <code>List&lt;S&gt;</code> is considered to be a subtype of <code>List&lt;? extends T&gt;</code> when
      <code>S</code> is a subtype of <code>T</code>.

        </div>
      </div>

      - Wildcards also introduce <i>contravariant subtyping</i> for generics, in that type <code>List&lt;S&gt;</code> is considered to be a <i>subtype</i> of
      <code>List&lt;? super T&gt;</code> when <code>S</code> is a supertype of <code>T</code> (as opposed to a subtype). Arrays do not support contravariant subtyping. <br>
      - Choose <code>Collection</code>s over <code>array</code>s because collections are more flexible and they provide many more methods compared to the standard array. On the
      other hand, arrays of primitive type are much more efficient since they don't involve boxing; and assignments into such an array need not check for an array store exception,
      because arrays of primitive type do not have subtypes. And despite the check for array store exceptions, even arrays of reference type may be more efficient than collection
      classes with the current generation of compilers, so you may want to use arrays in crucial inner loops. But this might change in the future(?). <br>
      - In some sense, covariant arrays are an artifact of the lack of generics in earlier versions of Java. Once you have generics, covariant arrays are probably the wrong design
      choice, and the only reason for retaining them is backward compatibility. <br>
      - Wow. For many purposes, it may be sensible to consider arrays a deprecated type.

    <div class="sub-heading">Wildcards Versus Type Parameters</div>
    <div>
      - Consider the following two methods on the <code>Collection</code> interface: <code>contains</code> and <code>containsAll</code>. <br>
      - The <code>contains</code> method is defined as follows: <code>boolean contains(Object o);</code> <br>
      - The <code>containsAll</code> method is defined as follows: <code>boolean containsAll(Collection&lt;?&gt; c);</code> <br>
      - The first method does not even use generics. What this means is that it is perfectly legal code to search for a <code>String</code> in a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>
      for example. <br>
      - <p class="highlight-text">The second example, <code>containsAll</code> introduces something new. The abbreviated type <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code> stands for
      <code>Collection&lt;? extends Object&gt;</code>. Extending <code>Object</code> is one of the most common uses of wildcards, so it makes sense to provide a short form for
      writing it. </p> <br>

        </div>
      </div>

      - You could rewrite the <code>Collection</code> interface to make use of type parameters instead of wildcards (as we did in the above example). <br>
      - So now we can check whether a list of objects contains a list of integers, but not the other way around. This option of using types should be the preferred one, and not the
      one that the JDK library uses.

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Wildcard Capture</div>
    <div>
      - When a generic method is invoked, the type parameter may be chosen to match the unknown type represented by a wildcard. This is called <i>wildcard capture</i>. (Question:
      What? Basically means we are going to replace the wildcard <code>?</code> with a type parameter <code>T</code>) <br>
      - Consider the method <code>reverse</code> in the <code>Collections</code> class that accepts a <code>List</code> of any type and reverses it. It has the following two
      method signatures that are equivalent: <br>
      a) <code>public static void reverse(List&lt;?&gt; list);</code> <br>
      b) <code>public static void &lt;T&gt; reverse(List&lt;T&gt; list);</code> <br>
      - The library uses the wildcard one. Let's see the difference in the implementation of the two method signatures.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>

      - Another reason to know about wildcard capture is that it can show up in error messages. In general, each occurrence of a wildcard is taken to stand for some unknown type.
      If the compiler prints an error message containing this type, it is referred to as <code>capture of ?</code>. Hence, if you see the quizzical phrase <code>capture of ?</code>
      in an error message, it will come from a wildcard type. Even if there are two distinct wildcards, the compiler will print the type associated with each as
      <code>capture of ?</code>. Bounded wildcards generate names that are even more long-winded, such as <code>capture of ? extends Number</code>. <br>
      - Question: How does method overloading work with wildcards/generics? <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Restrictions on Wildcards</div>
    <div>
      - Wildcards may not appear at the top level in class instance creation expressions (<code>new</code>), in explicit type parameters in generic method calls, or in supertypes
      (<code>extends</code> and <code>implements</code>).

      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Instance Creation</p>: In a class instance creation expression, if the type is a parameterized type, then none of the type parameters may be
      wildcards. Only top-level parameters in instance creation are prohibited from containing wildcards. Nested wildcards are permitted. <br>
      - This restriction of not being able to instantiate classes with wildcard types was necessry because the Java designers had in mind that every wildcard type is shorthand for
      some ordinary type, so they believed that ultimately every object should be created with an ordinary type. <br>
      - You can think of the relation between wildcard and ordinary types as the relation between interface and classes. You cannot instantiate interfaces, can you? So you cannot
      instantiate wildcard types either.

      <p class="inline-heading">Supertypes</p>: When a class instance is created, it invokes the initializer for its supertype. Hence, any restriction that applies to instance
      creation must also apply to supertypes. In a class declaration, if the supertype or any superinterface has type parameters, these types must not be wildcards.

    <div class="sub-heading">Comparable</div>
    <div>
      - The interface <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code> contains a method that can be used to compare one object to another. <br>
      - Why do I remember already doing this somewhere else? Here is what the <code>Comparable</code> interface looks like. <br>
      - The <code>compareTo</code> method returns a value that is negative, zero, or positive depending upon whether the argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the given
      object. When a class implements <code>Comparable</code>, the ordering specified by this interface is called the <i>natural ordering</i> for that class. <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

      </div>

      - Typically, an object belonging to a class can only be compared to another object belonging to the same class. For instance, both the <code>Integer</code> and the
      <code>String</code> class implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface, and hence you can compare one integer to another, but not one string to another integer.
      Just for reference, this is what the signature for <code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> class looks like: <br>
      <code>public final class String implements java.io.Serializable, Comparable&lt;String&gt;, CharSequence</code> <br>
      <code>public final class Integer extends Number implements Comparable&lt;Integer&gt;</code> <br>
      <code>public abstract class Number implements java.io.Serializable</code> <br>
      - Also note that, you cannot compare <code>Integer</code> to a <code>Number</code>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>

      - There is the concept of <i>natural ordering being consistent with the <code>equals</code> method</i>. What this means is that the following statement should hold true:
      <code>x.equals(y)</code> iff <code>x.compareTo(y) == 0</code>. <br>
      - This becomes important when you are making use of collection such as <code>SortedSet</code> or <code>SortedMap</code>. Check the <code>SortedSet</code> example on the
      <a href="../LeetCode/LeetCode.html#LC_HashSet">LeetCode page here</a>. When we pass in a custom comparator to the sorted set, we see that the string "Eve" is not added to the
      set because "Bob" was already added. This is because we passed in a custom comparator, that uses the <i>length</i> of two strings to check for equality. It sees that "Eve"
      has the same length as "Bob", and decides that the two strings are "equal", and hence does not add "Eve" to the set. Clearly, if you did <code>"Eve".equals("Bob")</code>, you
      would get false as the result. Hence, this is an instance of the <code>compareTo</code> being inconsistent with the <code>equals</code>. This does not seem to be necessarily
      a bad thing in this case, because we are passing in a custom comparator. But when we are trying to decide a <i>natural ordering</i> of a class, by making the class
      <code>implements</code> the <code>Comparable</code> interface, we want to be careful that the <code>compareTo</code> <i>is consistent</i> with the
      <code>equals</code> method that is defined in the class. Later, we will be taking a look at another sample class where the <code>equals</code> and <code>compareTo</code> are
      inconsistent, meaning, <code>compareTo</code> returns 0 on comparing two objects (implying that they are equal), but if you compared the two objects using the
      <code>equals</code> implementation of the class, the <code>equals</code> method would return false. <br>
      - Comparison differs from equality in that is does not accept a null argument. If x is not null, <code>x.equals(null)</code> must return false, while
      <code>x.compareTo(null)</code> must throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>. <br>
      - Text goes on to discuss the contract of implementing a <code>Comparable</code> interface.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Maximum of a Collection</div>
    <div>
      - Here we have a generic method that declares a <i>bound</i> on the type variable. The method <i>max</i> takes a collection of type <code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code> and
      returns a <code>T</code>, and it does this for any type <code>T</code> such that <code>T</code> is a subtype of <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>. <br>
      - The phrase in angle brackets at the beginning of the type signature declares the type variable <code>T</code>, and we say that <code>T</code> is bounded by
      <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>. In this case, the bound is recursive, in that the bound on <code>T</code> itself depends upon <code>T</code>. <br>
      - As with wildcards, bounds for type variables are always indicated by the keyword <code>extends</code>, even when the bound is an interface rather than a class, as is the
      case here. <br>
      - <p class="highlight-text">Unlike wildcards, type variables must always be bounded using <code>extends</code>, never <code>super</code>.</p> <br>
      - Note the error on using the <code>&gt;</code> operator. You can read up about what is causing this <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45153497/operator-cannot-be-applied-to-t-t-for-bounded-generic-type">on SO here</a>.

      - <p class="highlight-text">Signatures for methods should be as general as possible to maximize utility. If you can replace a type parameter with a wildcard then you should
      do so.</p> <br>
      - We improve the signature of <i>max</i> by replacing <code>&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T max(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll)</code> with
      <code>&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; T max(Collection&lt;? extends T&gt; coll)</code> <br>
      - Following the Get and Put Principle, we use <code>extends</code> with <code>Collection</code> because we <i>get</i> values of type <code>T</code> from the collection, and
      we use <code>super</code> with <code>Comparable</code> because we <p class="highlight-text"><i>put</i> value of type <code>T</code> into the <code>compareTo</code> method</p>
      . In the next section, we'll see an example that would not type-check if the <code>super</code> clause above was omitted. <br>

    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Fruity Example</div>
    <div>
      - The <code>Comparable</code> interface gives us fine control over what can and cannot be compared. Say, for instance, that we have a <i>Fruit</i> class, that has two
      subclasses <i>Apple</i> and <i>Orange</i>. Then depending on how we set things up, we can either <i>allow</i> comparison of <i>Apple</i> and <i>Orange</i>, or we may prohibit
      the comparison of the two. The first example that we are going to look at will allow comparison of <i>Apple</i> and <i>Orange</i>, whereas the second one will not. <br>
      - In the first example, each fruit has a <i>name</i> and a <i>size</i>. Two fruits are <i>equal</i> if they have the same <i>name</i> and the same <i>size</i>. Refer the
      <code>equals</code> method in the below example to verify that that is in fact what we are doing. Following good practice, when you override the <code>equals</code> method,
      you should also override the <code>hashCode</code> method, as we have done in the examples below. <br>
      - When it comes to <i>comparing</i> two objects, we are comparing <i>Fruit</i> based solely on its <i>size</i> and ignoring its <i>name</i>. <br>
      - Since <i>Fruit</i> <code>implements</code> <code>Comparable&lt;Fruit&gt;</code>, any two <i>Fruit</i>s can be compared. And that is why, we are able to find the max in a
      list of <i>Fruit</i>s that contains both <i>Apple</i> and <i>Orange</i>.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>

      - Example 2 now. What would you do if you wanted to <i>prohibit</i> the comparison of <i>Apple</i> and <i>Orange</i>? <br>
      - The difference between the earlier and this code is that, one, the <i>Apple</i> class now <code>implements</code> the <code>Comparable&lt;Apple&gt;</code> (instead of the
      <i>Fruit</i> class implementing the interface). This means that an instance of <i>Apple</i> can now ONLY be compared to another instance of <i>Apple</i>. Similarly, for <i>Orange</i>,
      we implement the <code>Comparable&lt;Orange&gt;</code> interface, and thus making sure that when you call the <code>compareTo</code> method on instances of the <i>Orange</i>
      class, you can only pass in other instances of <i>Orange</i> class as args. <br>
      - Two, note that the code doing the comparison is in the base <i>Fruit</i> class which prevents duplicating the logic in both the <i>Apple</i> and the <i>Orange</i> classes.
      Also, the method is now marked as <code>protected</code>, so that it can only be called from within the same package, or from other classes that <code>extends</code> the
      base class that are also outside the package in which the <i>Fruit</i> class is present. Note that we can still directly use <i>internalCompareTo</i> method to compare two
      instances of <i>Fruit</i>, but that is not the intended way that we want this method to be used. <br>
      - Also, just so you can recall, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71903317/using-comparable-interface-to-prohibit-comparison-between-inherited-types">this is a
      confusion that you had for which you asked the question on SO</a>. <br>

      - The method declaration of the <code>max</code> method looks like this:
      <code>public static &lt;T extends Object & Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; T max(Collection&lt;? extends T&gt; coll)</code>. We were in the process of understanding the
      recursive type that is used in the method declaration by forming it ourselves in the <i>FindingMax</i> code example in the "Maximum of a Collection" section above. We reached
      upto forming this method signature: <code>public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T findMax(Collection&lt;T&gt; collection)</code>. So the question now is, why
      do we need the <code>public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; T max(Collection&lt;? extends T&gt; coll)</code> <br>
      - In the below example we are using the <i>Apple</i>, <i>Orange</i>, and <i>Fruit</i> class from the Example 1 above where we were allowing <i>Apple</i> and <i>Orange</i> to
      be compared to each other because the <i>Fruit</i> class implemented the <code>Comparable</code> interface.

      </div>

      - If you tried to do the same thing, but with the <i>Apple</i>, <i>Orange</i>, and <i>Fruit</i> class from the Example 2 where we did not allow <i>Apple</i> to be compared to
      <i>Orange</i> because the <code>Comparable</code> interface was implemented individually by the child classes, you get the following:

    <div class="sub-heading">What are the 4 pillars of Reactive Programming</div>
    <div>
      - Notes have been taken from Venkat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG2SEcl1aMM">presentation</a>.

      <li><p class="inline-heading">Elasticity</p>: <br>
        How many threads should I create? <br>
        There are 2 scenarios - <br>
        a) If your task is computation intensive, then the number of threads that you create should be &lt= the
        number of cores in you system. <br>
        b) If your task is IO intensive, then in that case your number of threads should be <br>
        <code># of threads &lt= # of cores / (1 - blocking factor) </code> <br>
        The point is that it is incorrect to assume that the number of threads depends on the memory. <br>
        Ok, so what if my program is doing IO operations on multiple threads? How do I go about calculating the
        ideal number of threads then? <br>

        What is <code>blocking factor</code> supposed to be? <br>
        - ???
      </li>

      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Message-Driven</p>: <br>
        THe idea is that you should never share database. That is if you have multiple microservices taht want
        to access the database, you should export the data from the database and make it available to the
        microservice instead of having them individually access the DB instead.
      </li>

      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Responsive</p>: <br>
        - Infinite-scrolling is an example. You can amortize the cost of fetching a page by fetching the page in
        the background while the user is scrolling.
      </li>

      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Resilience</p>: <br>
        - Fail task successfully. <br>
        - Add circuit-breakers to your application/allow partial-access to the app if some data is not reachable
        <br>
      </li>

      - Reactive programming is functionalProgramming++. It builds on functional composition and lazy evaluation and takes the abstraction even further.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Concurrency vs Parallelism</div>
    <div>
      - Fork/Join Frameworks and Parallel Streams are examples of Parallelism. They divide a task into multiple sub-tasks and perform those sub-tasks on <i>different</i>
      cores, CPUs, or even machines. <br>
      - Conversely, when you are dealing with concurrency, you are trying to perform multiple loosely-related tasks on the <i>same</i> CPU. The objective being to keep the
      core as busy as possible to maximize the throughput of your application. You want to avoid blocking a thread and wasting its computational resources while waiting
      (potentially for quite a while) for a result from a remote service or from interrogating a database. <br>
      - Concurrency is a programming property (overlapped execution) that can occur even for a single-core machine, whereas parallelism is a property of execution hardware
      (simultaneous execution).

    <div class="sub-heading">Evolving Java support for expressing concurrency</div>
    <div>
      - Terms: Java had locks (via <code>synchronized</code> classes and methods), <code>Runnable</code>s, and <code>Thread</code>s. The <code>ExecutorService</code>
      interface extends the <code>Executor</code> interface with the <code>submit</code> method to run a <code>Callable</code>; the <code>Executor</code> interface merely has
      an <code>execute</code> method for <code>Runnable</code>s. Hence, <code>ExecutorService</code> can execute both <code>Runnable</code>s and <code>Callable</code>s.
      <code>Callable&ltT&gt</code> and <code>Future&ltT&gt</code>, which produced higher-level and result-returning variants of <code>Runnable</code> and <code>Thread</code>
      and used generics.

      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">What is the difference between <code>Callable</code> and <code>Runnable</code>?</p> <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3952292/8742428">SO Link</a> <br>
      - Java 9, provided explicit support for distributed asynchronous programming. (How?) <br>
      - A process can request that the operating system allocate it one or more threads. Each core can be used for one or more processes or threads, but if your program
      doesn't use threads, it's effectively using only one of the processor cores. <br>
      - My task manager shows that I have 4 cores (8 logical processors), but 4400+ threads running currently. How is this possible? The number of operating system (and Java)
      threads will significantly exceed the number of hardware threads, so all the hardware threads (We'd use the word <i>core</i> here, but CPUs like the Intel i7-6900K have
      multiple hardware threads per core) can be usefully occupied executing code even when some operating-system threads are blocked or sleeping. Each core would be able to
      execute one thread simultaneously. So if there are 30 threads and 4 cores, 26 threads will be waiting to get context switched to get executed. Something like, thread
      1-4 runs for 200ms and then 5-8 runs for 200 ms and so on. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26685128/8742428">A single core can also support multiple threads.</a>
      <br>
      - See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5593328/software-threads-vs-hardware-threads">this difference </a> between software threads, hardware threads,
      and java threads. <br>
      - <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html">Note that the</a> JVM runs on top of a native OS, and that the JVM specification
      does not specify what model to use for mapping Java threads to kernel threads. This decision is JVM implementation dependant, and may be one-to-one, many-to-many, or
      many to one.. (On a UNIX system the JVM normally uses PThreads and on a Windows system it normally uses windows threads.) <br>
      - Java 5 provided the Executor framework and the idea of thread pools as a higher-level idea capturing the power of threads, which allow Java programmers to decouple
      <i>task submission</i> from <i>task execution</i>.

      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">So how do I use concurrency in my program?</p> <br>
      - You could manually create <code>new Thread()</code> and then use <code>Callable</code> or <code>Runnable</code>. But then the question is: how many new threads should
      you create? Remember if you exceed the number of <code>operating system</code> threads that the system is capable of, it would likely cause the application to crash.
      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">So what should we do instead?</p> <br>
      - Use Thread Pools instead of directly creating a thread. <br>
      - The <code>ExecutorService</code> in Java provides a way to submit a task and then obtain its result later. <br>
      - It uses the <code>ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads)</code> method. This method creates a <code>ExecutorService</code> containing <code>nThreads</code>
      (often called <i>worker threads</i>) and stores them in a thread pool, from which unused threads are taken to run submitted tasks on a first-come, first-served basis.
      These threads are returned to the pool when their tasks terminate. So you can submit a large number of <i>tasks</i> to the pool while keeping the total number of
      threads created to a hardware-appropriate number. Note the wording: The programmer provides a <i>task</i> (a <code>Runnable</code> or a <code>Callable</code>), which is
      executed by a thread.
      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Thread pools are bad though. Why?</p> <br>
      - A thread pool with <i>k</i> threads can execute only <i>k</i> tasks concurrently. Any further task submissions are held in a queue and not allocated a thread until
      one of the existing tasks completes. This situation is generally good, in that it allows you to submit many tasks without accidentally creating an excessive number of
      threads, but you have to be wary of tasks that sleep or wait for I/O or network connections. <br>
      - For eg., if you have 20 tasks submitted to a thread pool of size 5, and 3 of those threads in the pool end up waiting/blocking on some kind of I/O op, the remaining
      15 tasks in the queue will end up having only 2 threads for their execution. <br>
      - It's even possible to cause deadlock in a thread pool if earlier task submissions or already running tasks, need to wait for later task submissions, which is a
      typical use-pattern for Futures. <br>

  <div class="textual-content">

    <div class="sub-heading">What are the two types of multitasking</div>
    <div>
      - Two types:
      <ul>
        <li><b>process-based</b>:
          <br>
          - A process is, in essence, a program that is executing. Thus, process-based
          multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. For
          example, process-based multitasking enables you to run the Java compiler at the same time that you
          are using a text editor or visiting a web site. In process-based multitasking, a program is the
          smallest unit of code that can be dispatched by the scheduler.
          <br>
          - Processes are heavy-weight tasks that require their own separate address space.
          <br>
          - Interprocess communication is expensive and limited.
          <br>
          - Context switching from one process to another is also costly.
        </li>
        <li><b>thread-based</b>:
          <br>
          - It is the smallest unit of dispatchable code. This means that a single program can
          perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For example, a text editor can print text at the same time
          as the text is being formatted, so long as the two tasks are being performed by two different
          threads.
          <br>
          - Threads are lighter-weight and require less overhead when compared to process-based multitasking
          <br>
          - They share the same address space.
          <br>
          - Interthread communication is inexpensive, and context switching from one thread to another is
          lower in cost.
        </li>
      </ul>
      - In <i>process</i>-based multitasking, two or more programs can run at the same time. In <i>thread</i>-based
      multitasking, two or more tasks from the <i>same</i> program can run simultaneously.
      - A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program
      is called a <i>thread</i>.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">The Java Thread Model</div>
    <div>
      - Single threaded applications use an approach called <i>event loop with polling</i>. In general, in a
      single-threaded environment, when a thread blocks (that is, suspends execution) because it is waiting for
      some resource, the entire program stops running.
      <br>
      - The benefit of Java's multithreading is that the main loop/polling mechanism is eliminated. When a
      thread blocks in a Java program, only the single thread that is blocked pauses. All other threads continue
      to run.
      <br>
      - Threads exist in several states. A thread can be <i>running</i>. It can be <i>ready to run</i> as soon as
      it gets CPU time. A running thread can be <i>suspended</i>, which temporarily halts its activity. A
      suspended thread can be <i>resumed</i>, allowing it to pick up where it left off. A thread can be
      <i>blocked</i> when waiting for a resource. At any time, a thread can be <i>terminated</i>, which halts its
      execution immediately. Once terminated, a thread cannot be resumed.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Thread Priorities</div>
    <div>
      - Java assigns to each thread a priority. Thread priorities are integers that specify the relative priority
      of one thread to another.
      <br>
      - A thread's priority is used to decide when to switch from one running thread to the next. This is called a
      <i>context switch</i>. <br>
      - Rules for context switch:
      <ul>
        <li>A thread can voluntarily relinquish control. This occurs when explicitly yielding, sleeping, or when
          blocked. In this scenario, all other threads are examined, and the highest-priority thread that is
          ready to run is given the CPU.
        </li>
        <li> A thread can be preempted by a higher-priority thread. In this case, a
          lower-priority thread that does not yield the processor is simply preempted - no matter what it is
          doing - by a higher-priority thread. Basically, as soon as a higher-priority thread wants to run, it
          does. This is called <i>preemptive multitasking</i>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">The Thread Class and the Runnable Interface</div>
    <div>
      - To create a new thread, you program will extend the <code>Thread</code> class or implement the <code>Runnable</code>
      interface.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">The Main Thread</div>
    <div>
      - <i>main thread</i> is the thread that is executed when when your program begins. The main thread is
      important for two reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>It is the thread from which other "child" threads will be spawned.</li>
        <li>Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown
          actions.
        </li>
      </ul>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Creating a Thread</div>
    <div>
      - You create a thread by instantiating an object of type <code>Thread</code>. This can be done in two ways:
      <ul>
        <li>You can implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface</li>
        <li>You can extend the <code>Thread</code> class itself</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="implementingRunnable" class="sub-heading">Implementing Runnable</div>
    <div>
      - The <code>Runnable</code> class should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be
      executed by a thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called <code>run</code>. <br>
      - Inside <code>run()</code> you will define the code that constitutes the new thread. After you create a
      class that implements <code>Runnable</code>, you will instantiate an object of type <code>Thread</code> from
      within that class. <br>
      - The <code>Thread</code> class defines many constructors. The one we use here is:
      <code>Thread(Runnable threadObj, String threadName)</code>. Here, <i>threadObj</i> is an instance of a class
      that implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. This defines where the execution of the thread will
      begin. The name of the new thread is specified by <i>threadName</i>. <br>
      - After the new thread is created, it will not start running unless you call its <code>start()</code>
      method. The <code>start()</code> method actually calls the <code>run()</code> method of the class that is
      referenced by <i>threadObj</i>. <br>

      <code>class PrimeRun implements Runnable {</code><br>
      <code> long minPrime;</code><br>
      <code> PrimeRun(long minPrime) {</code><br>
      <code> this.minPrime = minPrime;</code><br>
      <code> }</code><br>
      <code> public void run() {</code><br>
      <code> // compute primes larger than minPrime</code><br>
      <code> }</code><br>
      <code>}</code><br>

      The following code would then create a thread and start it running: <br>
      <code>PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);</code><br>
      <code>new Thread(p).start();</code><br>
      <code>//or</code><br>
      <code>Thread t = new Thread(p);</code><br>
      <code>t.start();</code><br>

      - Passing <code>this</code> as the first argument indicates that you want the new thread to call the
      <code>run()</code> method on this object. Inside <code>main()</code>, <code>start()</code> is called, which
      starts the thread of execution beginning at the <code>run()</code> method. This causes the child thread's
      for loop to begin. Next the main thread enters its for loop. Both threads continue running, sharing the CPU
      in single-core systems, until their loops finish.

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Extending Thread</div>
    <div>
      - The second way to create a thread is to create a new class that extends <code>Thread</code>, and then to
      create an
      instance of that class. The extending class must override the <code>run()</code> method, which is the entry
      point for
      the new thread. As before, a call to <code>start()</code> begins execution of the new thread.
      <br>
      <code>class PrimeThread extends Thread {</code><br>
      <code> long minPrime;</code><br>
      <code> PrimeThread(long minPrime) {</code><br>
      <code> this.minPrime = minPrime;</code><br>
      <code> }</code><br>

      <code> public void run() {</code><br>
      <code> // compute primes larger than minPrime</code><br>
      <code> }</code><br>
      <code>}</code><br>

      The following code would then create a thread and start it running: <br>
      <code>PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);</code><br>
      <code>p.start();</code>

      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8579657/whats-the-difference-between-thread-start-and-runnable-run">What's
      the difference between start() and run()</a>
      <br>
      - Well if you defined the <code>NewThread</code> class as: calling <code>run()</code> is literally
      going to call the <code>run()</code> method, like a
      literal method call. No new thread is going to be created. So in the <a href="#implementingRunnable">example
      above</a>, if you wrote <code>newThread.thread.run()</code> on Line 32, there would be a method call to the
      <code>run()</code> method. The <code>run()</code> method would finish executing. And only after that would
      the execution of the loop in te Main class even start. Only if you use the <code>start()</code> method is a
      new thread created and the code inside the <code>run()</code> method executed.
      <br>
      - Another difference between <code>start()</code> and <code>run()</code> in Java thread is that you can not
      call <code>start()</code> twice. Once started, second <code>start()</code> call will throw <code>IllegalStateException</code>
      in Java while you can call <code>run()</code> method several times since it's just an ordinary method.

      should you use <code>Runnable</code> vs when should you use <code>Thread</code>?</a>.
      <br>
      - Almost always you will be using the <code>MyThread implements Runnable</code> interface to create a
      new thread.
      <br>
      - Classes should be extended only when they are being enhanced or adapted in some way. So, if you will not
      be overriding any of Thread's other methods, it is probably best simply to implement <code>Runnable</code>.
      Also, by implementing Runnable, your thread class does not need to inherit Thread, making it free to inherit
      a
      different class.

      <br>
      - Because sometimes (almost never, but sometimes) you want to be able to change the basic behaviour of
      Thread. That's when you'll need to extend it. You can change it by overriding a method from the Thread
      class, you can't do it by implementing one from Runnable. <br>

      - Your program can spawn as many threads as you need.
      <br>
      - In the below example we are creating multiple threads. In the printout, note where the Main thread is
      exiting. It is not like Main is waiting for the other threads to end.

    <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>isAlive()</code> and <code>join()</code></div>
    <div>
      - Look at the previous example. The main thread finished ealrier than the child threads. Often, you would
      want the main thread to finish last.
      <br>
      - Two ways exist to determine whether a thread has finished or not. First, you can call
      <code>isAlive()</code> on the thread which returns true if the thread is still running.
      <br>
      - But you should prefer the <code>join()</code> method. This method waits until the thread on which it is
      called terminates. It's name comes from the concept of the calling thread waiting until the specified thread
      joins it. <code>join</code> also allows you to specify a maximum amount of time that you want to
      wait for the specified thread to terminate.
      <ul>
        <li><code>void join()</code>: Waits for this thread to die.</li>
        <li><code>void join(long millis)</code>: Waits at most millis milliseconds for this thread to die.</li>
        <li><code>void join(long millis, int nanos)</code>: Waits at most millis milliseconds plus nanos
          nanoseconds for this thread to die.
        </li>
      </ul>
      - In the below example, remember that the main thread that is calling <code>mt1.join</code> (and others)
      will wait for the <code>mt1</code> to finish. The <code>mt2</code> thread is running in parallel and is not
      affected by the <code>mt1</code> and <code>mt1.join()</code> method calls at all. <a

    <div class="sub-heading">Thread Priorities</div>
    <div>
      - Thread priority is just a hint to OS task scheduler and is dependent on the underlying OS. OS will try to
      allocate more resources to a high priority thread but it does not guarantee it. So if your program is
      dependent on thread priorities than you are in-turn binding your program to underlying OS, which is bad.
      <br>
      - From Java Concurrency in Practice: Avoid the temptation to use thread priorities, since they increase
      platform dependence and can cause liveness problems. Most concurrent applications can use the default
      priority for all threads. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20333255/8742428">Link to post on SO</a>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Synchronization</div>
    <div>
      - When two or more threads need access to a shared resource, they need some way to ensure that the resource
      will be used by only one thread at a time. The process by which this is achieved is called synchronization.
      <br>
      - Key to synchronization is the concept of the monitor. A monitor is an object that is used as a mutually
      exclusive lock. Only one thread can own a monitor at a given time. When a thread acquires a lock, it is said
      to have entered the monitor. All other threads attempting to enter the locked monitor will be suspended
      until the first thread exits the monitor. These other threads are said to be waiting for the monitor. A
      thread that owns a monitor can reenter the same monitor if it so desires.
      <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9848796/8742428">SO Link explaining what a monitor actually is</a>
      <br>
      - This is what happens when your code is NOT synchronized.

        </div>
      </div>
      - By calling <code>sleep()</code>, the <code>call()</code> method allows execution to switch to another
      thread. This results in the
      mixed-up output of the three message strings. In this program, nothing exists to stop all three threads from
      calling the same method, on the same object, at the same time. This is known as a race condition, because
      the three threads are racing each other to complete the method.
      <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>synchronized</code> methods</div>
    <div>
      - To prevent the above, you need to <i>serialize</i> the access to the <i>method</i> <code>call()</code>.
      That is, you must restrict its access to only one thread at a time. To do this, you simply need to precede
      <code>call()</code>'s definition with the keyword <code>synchronized</code>.
      <br>
      <code>class CallMe{</code>
      <br>
      <code> synchronized void callMe(){...}</code>
      <br>
      <code>}</code>
      <br>
      - This prevents other threads from entering the method <code>call()</code> when another thread is already
      using it. And after we make this change, we get the correct output:
      <br>
      [Hello]
      <br>
      [World]
      <br>
      [Synchronized]
      <br>
      Example of using the synchronized statement:

        </div>
      </div>
      Well we would have expected "Hello Synchronized World". But threads gonna thread I guess.
      <br>
      Any time that you have a method, or group of methods, that manipulates the internal state of an object in a
      multithreaded situation, you should use the <code>synchronized</code> keyword to guard the state from race
      conditions.
      Remember, once a thread enters any synchronized method on an instance, no other thread can enter any other
      synchronized method on the same instance. However, nonsynchronized methods on that instance will continue to
      be callable.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>synchronized</code> Statements</div>
    <div>
      - Creating <code>synchronized</code> methods within classes might not always work.
      <br>
      - Imagine that you want to synchronize access to objects of a class that was not designed for multithreaded
      access. That is, the class does not use synchronized methods. Further, this class was not created by you,
      but by a third party, and you do not have access to the source code. Thus, you can't add synchronized to the
      appropriate methods within the class. How can access to an object of this class be synchronized?
      <br>
      - You put calls to the methods defined by the class inside a <code>synchronized</code> block.
      <br>
      - This is the general form of the <code>synchronized</code> statement:
      <br>
      <code>synchronized(objRef){</code>
      <br>
      <code> //Statements to be synchronized</code>
      <br>
      <code>}</code>
      <br>
      Here <code>objRef</code> is the reference to the object being synchronized. A synchronized block ensures
      that a call to a method that is a member of <code>objRef</code>'s class occurs only after the current thread
      has successfully entered <code>objRef</code>'s monitor.
      <br>
      - The previous example can then be rewritten in the following manner:

    <div class="sub-heading">Interthread Communication</div>
    <div>
      - //TODO: Read up on what Polling is
      <br>
      - In Java , you have <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, and <code>notifyAll()</code> methods. These
      methods are implemented as <code>final</code> methods in <code>Object</code>, so all classes have them. All
      3 methods can be called only from within a <code>synchronized</code> context.
      <ul>
        <li><code>notify()</code>:
          <br>
          - Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If any
          threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary
          and occurs at the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's monitor by calling
          one of the wait methods.
          <br>
          - The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on
          this object. The awakened thread will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
          be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the awakened thread enjoys no
          reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object.
          <br>
          - This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. A thread
          becomes the owner of the object's monitor in one of three ways:
          <ul>
            <li>By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.</li>
            <li>By executing the body of a synchronized statement that synchronizes on the object.</li>
            <li>For objects of type Class, by executing a synchronized static method of that class.</li>
          </ul>
          - Only one thread at a time can own an object's monitor.
        </li>
        <li><code>notifyAll</code>:
          <br>
          - Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. A thread
          waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the wait methods.
          The awakened threads will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on
          this object. The awakened threads will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
          be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the awakened threads enjoy no
          reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object.
          <br>
          - This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. See the
          notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>wait()</code>:
          <br>
          - Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method or the
          notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed.
          The current thread must own this object's monitor.
          <br>
          - This method causes the current thread (call it T) to place itself in the wait set for this object
          and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread T becomes disabled
          for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens:
          <ul>
            <li>Some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread T happens to be
              arbitrarily
              chosen as the thread to be awakened.
            </li>
            <li>Some other thread invokes the notifyAll method for this object.</li>
            <li>Some other thread interrupts thread T.</li>
            <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less. If timeout is zero, however,
              then real
              time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
            </li>
          </ul>
          - The thread T is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread
          scheduling.
          It then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object;
          once it has gained control of the object, all its synchronization claims on the object are restored
          to the status quo ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked.
          Thread T then returns from the invocation of the wait method. Thus, on return from the wait method,
          the synchronization state of the object and of thread T is exactly as it was when the wait method
          was invoked.
        </li>
      </ul>
      - Code without using any kind of inter-thread communication: <br>
      - The problem with this code is that although the <code>put()</code> and <code>get()</code> methods on Q are
      synchronized, nothing is stopping the producer from overrunning the consumer, nor will anything stop the
      consumer from consuming the same queue value twice. Hence you get erroneous output.

      - Code after using inter-thread communication: <br>
      - Inside <code>get()</code>, <code>wait()</code> is called. This causes it's execution to suspend until
      Producer notifies you that some data is ready. When this happens execution inside <code>get</code> resumes.
      After the data has been obtained <code>get</code> calls <code>notify</code>. This tells the producer that it
      is ok to put more data in the queue. Inside <code>put()</code>, <code>wait</code> suspends execution until
      Consumer has removed the item from the queue. When the execution resumes, the next item of data is out in
      the queue, and notify is called. This tells the Consumer that it should now remove it.

    <div class="sub-heading">Deadlock</div>
    <div>
      - A special type of error that you need to avoid that relates specifically to multitasking is deadlock,
      which occurs when two threads have a circular dependency on a pair of synchronized objects. For example,
      suppose one thread enters the monitor on object X and another thread enters the monitor on object Y. If the
      thread in X tries to call any synchronized method on Y, it will block as expected. However, if the thread in
      Y, in turn, tries to call any synchronized method on X, the thread waits forever, because to access X, it
      would have to release its own lock on Y so that the first thread could complete.
      - Code showing how Deadlock can be created:
      <br>
      - The next example creates two classes, A and B, with methods foo() and bar(), respectively, which pause
      briefly before trying to call a method in the other class. The main class, named Deadlock, creates an A and
      a B instance, and then calls deadlockStart() to start a second thread that sets up the deadlock condition.
      The foo() and bar() methods use sleep() as a way to force the deadlock condition to occur.

    <div class="sub-heading">Suspending, Resuming, and Stopping Threads</div>
    <div>
      - A thread must be designed so that the <code>run()</code> method periodically checks to determine whether
      that thread should suspend, resume, or stop its own execution.
      <br>
      - Typically, this is accomplished by establishing a flag variable that indicates the execution state of the
      thread. As long as this flag is set to "running," the <code>run()</code> method must continue to let the
      thread execute. If this variable is set to "suspend", the thread must pause. If it is set to "stop", the
      thread must terminate. Of course, a variety of ways exist in which to write such code, but the central theme
      will be the same for all programs.

    <div class="sub-heading">Parallel Programming via the Join/Fork Framework</div>
    <div>
      - It is important to point out the distinction between traditional multithreading and parallel programming.
      <br>
      - In the past, most computers had a single CPU and multithreading was primarily used to take advantage of
      idle time, such as when a program is waiting for user input. Using this approach, one thread can execute
      while another is waiting. In other words, on a single-CPU system, multithreading is used to allow two or
      more tasks to share the CPU. This type of multithreading is typically supported by an object of type Thread
      (as described in Chapter 11). Although this type of multithreading will always remain quite useful, it was
      not optimized for situations in which two or more CPUs are available (multicore computers).
      <br>
      - When multiple CPUs are present, a second type of multithreading capability that supports true parallel
      execution is required. With two or more CPUs, it is possible to execute portions of a program
      simultaneously, with each part executing on its own CPU. This can be used to significantly speed up the
      execution of some types of operations, such as sorting, transforming, or searching a large array. In many
      cases, these types of operations can be broken down into smaller pieces (each acting on a portion of the
      array), and each piece can be run on its own CPU.

      - At the core of the Fork/Join framework are the following 4 classes:
