            <li><b>Elasticity</b>: <br>
                How many threads should I create? <br>
                There are 2 scenarios - <br>
                a) If your task is computation intensive, then the number of threads that you create should be &lt= the
                number of cores in you system. <br>
                b) If your task is IO intensive, then in that case your number of threads should be <br>
                <code># of threads &lt= # of cores / (1 - blocking factor) </code> <br>
                The point is that it is incorrect to assume that the number of threads depends on the memory. <br>
                Ok, so what if my program is doing IO operations on multiple threads? How do I go about calculating the
                ideal number of threads then? <br>

                What is <code>blocking factor</code> supposed to be? <br>
                - ???
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Message-Driven</b>: <br>
                THe idea is that you should never share database. That is if you have multiple microservices taht want
                to access the database, you should export the data from the database and make it available to the
                microservice instead of having them individually access the DB instead.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Responsive</b>: <br>
                - Infinite-scrolling is an example. You can amortize the cost of fetching a page by fetching the page in
                the background while the user is scrolling.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Resilience</b>: <br>
                - Fail task successfully. <br>
                - Add circuit-breakers to your application/allow partial-access to the app if some data is not reachable
                <br>
            </li>

            - Reactive programming is functionalProgramming++. It builds on functional composition and lazy evaluation
            and takes the abstraction even further
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Concurrency vs Parallelism</div>
        <div>
            - Fork/Join Frameworks and Parallel Streams are examples of Parallelism. They divide a task into multiple
            sub-tasks and perform those sub-tasks on <i>different</i> cores, CPUs, or even machines. <br>
            - Conversely, when you are dealing with concurrency, you are trying to perform multiple loosely-related
            tasks on the <i>same</i> CPU. The objective being to keep the core as busy as possible to maximize the
            throughput of your application. You want to avoid blocking a thread and wasting its computational resources
            while waiting (potentially for quite a while) for a result from a remote service or from interrogating a
            database. <br>
            - Concurrency is a programming property (overlapped execution) that can occur even for a
            single-core machine, whereas parallelism is a property of execution hardware (simultaneous execution).

        <div>
            - Terms: Java had locks (via <code>synchronized</code> classes and methods), <code>Runnable</code>s, and
            <code>Thread</code>s. The <code>ExecutorService</code> interface extends the <code>Executor</code> interface
            with the
            <code>submit</code> method to run a <code>Callable</code>; the <code>Executor</code> interface merely has an
            <code>execute</code> method for <code>Runnable</code>s. Hence, <code>ExecutorService</code> can execute both
            <code>Runnable</code>s and <code>Callable</code>s. <code>Callable&ltT&gt</code>
            and <code>Future&ltT&gt</code>, which produced higher-level and result-returning variants of
            <code>Runnable</code> and <code>Thread</code> and used generics. <br>
            - What is the difference betn <code>Callable</code> and <code>Runnable</code>? <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3952292/8742428">SO Link</a> <br>
            - Java 9, provided explicit support for distributed asynchronous programming. (How?) <br>
            - A process can request that the operating system allocate it one or more threads. Each core can be used for
            one or more processes or threads, but if your program doesn't use threads, it's effectively using only one
            of the processor cores. <br>
            - My task manager shows that I have 4 cores (8 logical processors), but 4400+ threads running currently. How
            is this possible?
            The number of operating system (and Java) threads will significantly exceed the number of hardware threads,
            so all the hardware threads (We’d use the word <i>core</i> here, but CPUs like the Intel i7-6900K have
            multiple hardware threads per core) can be usefully occupied executing code even when some operating-system
            threads
            are blocked or sleeping. Each core would be able to execute one thread simultaneously. So if there are 30
            threads and 4 cores, 26 threads will be waiting to get context switched to get executed. Something like,
            thread 1-4 runs for 200ms and then 5-8 runs for 200 ms and so on.
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26685128/8742428">A single core can also support multiple threads.</a>
            <br>
            - See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5593328/software-threads-vs-hardware-threads">this
            difference </a> between software threads, hardware threads, and java threads. <br>
            - <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html">Note that the</a> JVM
            runs on top of a native OS, and that the JVM specification does not specify what model
            to use for mapping Java threads to kernel threads. This decision is JVM implementation dependant, and may be
            one-to-one, many-to-many, or many to one.. (On a UNIX system the JVM normally uses PThreads and on a
            Windows system it normally uses windows threads.) <br>
            - Java 5 provided the Executor framework and the idea of thread pools as a higher-level
            idea capturing the power of threads, which allow Java programmers to decouple <i>task submission</i>
            from <i>task execution</i>.

            <br>
            <br>

            - So how do I use concurrency in my program? <br>
            - You could manually create <code>new Thread()</code> and then use <code>Callable</code> or
            <code>Runnable</code>. But then the question is: how many new threads should you create? Remember if you
            exceed the number of <code>operating system</code> threads that the system is capable of, it would likely
            cause the application to crash.
            <br>
            <br>
            - So what should we do instead? <br>
            - Use Thread Pools instead of directly creating a thread. <br>
            - The <code>ExecutorService</code> in Java provides a way to submit a task and then obtain its result later.
            <br>
            - It uses the <code>ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads)</code> method. This method creates a
            <code>ExecutorService</code> containing <code>nThreads</code> (often called <i>worker threads</i>) and
            stores them in a thread pool, from which unused threads are taken to run
            submitted tasks on a first-come, first-served basis. These threads are returned to the pool
            when their tasks terminate. So you can submit a large number of <i>tasks</i> to the pool while keeping the
            total number of threads created to a hardware-appropriate number. Note the wording: The programmer provides
            a
            <i>task</i> (a <code>Runnable</code> or a <code>Callable</code>), which is executed by a thread.

            <br>
            <br>

            - Thread pools are bad though. Why? <br>
            - A thread pool with <i>k</i> threads can execute only <i>k</i> tasks concurrently. Any further
            task submissions are held in a queue and not allocated a thread until one of the
            existing tasks completes. This situation is generally good, in that it allows you to
            submit many tasks without accidentally creating an excessive number of
            threads, but you have to be wary of tasks that sleep or wait for I/O or network
            connections. <br>
            - For eg., if you have 20 tasks submitted to a thread pool of size 5, and 3 of those threads in the pool end
            up waiting/blocking on some kind of I/O op, the remaining 15 tasks in the queue will end up having only 2
            threads for their execution. <br>
            - It's even possible to cause deadlock in a thread pool if
            earlier task submissions or already running tasks, need to wait for later task submissions, which is a
            typical use-pattern for Futures. <br>

                    <br>
                    - A process is, in essence, a program that is executing. Thus, process-based
                    multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. For
                    example, process-based multitasking enables you to run the Java compiler at the same time that you
                    are using a text editor or visiting a web site. In process-based multitasking, a program is the
                    smallest unit of code that can be dispatched by the scheduler.
                    <br>
                    - Processes are heavy-weight tasks that require their own separate address space.
                    <br>
                    - Interprocess communication is expensive and limited.
                    <br>
                    - Context switching from one process to another is also costly.
                </li>
                <li><b>thread-based</b>:
                    <br>
                    - It is the smallest unit of dispatchable code. This means that a single program can
                    perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For example, a text editor can print text at the same time
                    as the text is being formatted, so long as the two tasks are being performed by two different
                    threads.
                    <br>
                    - Threads are lighter-weight and require less overhead when compared to process-based multitasking
                    <br>
                    - They share the same address space.
                    <br>
                    - Interthread communication is inexpensive, and context switching from one thread to another is
                    lower in cost.
                </li>
            </ul>
            - In <i>process</i>-based multitasking, two or more programs can run at the same time. In <i>thread</i>-based
            multitasking, two or more tasks from the <i>same</i> program can run simultaneously.
            - A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program
            is called a <i>thread</i>.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">The Java Thread Model</div>
        <div>
            - Single threaded applications use an approach called <i>event loop with polling</i>. In general, in a
            single-threaded environment, when a thread blocks (that is, suspends execution) because it is waiting for
            some resource, the entire program stops running.
            <br>
            - The benefit of Java's multithreading is that the main loop/polling mechanism is eliminated. When a
            thread blocks in a Java program, only the single thread that is blocked pauses. All other threads continue
            to run.
            <br>
            - Threads exist in several states. A thread can be <i>running</i>. It can be <i>ready to run</i> as soon as
            it gets CPU time. A running thread can be <i>suspended</i>, which temporarily halts its activity. A
            suspended thread can be <i>resumed</i>, allowing it to pick up where it left off. A thread can be
            <i>blocked</i> when waiting for a resource. At any time, a thread can be <i>terminated</i>, which halts its
            execution immediately. Once terminated, a thread cannot be resumed.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Thread Priorities</div>
        <div>
            - Java assigns to each thread a priority. Thread priorities are integers that specify the relative priority
            of one thread to another.
            <br>
            - A thread's priority is used to decide when to switch from one running thread to the next. This is called a
            <i>context switch</i>. <br>
            - Rules for context switch:
            <ul>
                <li>A thread can voluntarily relinquish control. This occurs when explicitly yielding, sleeping, or when
                    blocked. In this scenario, all other threads are examined, and the highest-priority thread that is
                    ready to run is given the CPU.
                </li>
                <li> A thread can be preempted by a higher-priority thread. In this case, a
                    lower-priority thread that does not yield the processor is simply preempted - no matter what it is
                    doing - by a higher-priority thread. Basically, as soon as a higher-priority thread wants to run, it
                    does. This is called <i>preemptive multitasking</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">The Thread Class and the Runnable Interface</div>
        <div>
            - To create a new thread, you program will extend the <code>Thread</code> class or implement the <code>Runnable</code>
            interface.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">The Main Thread</div>
        <div>
            - <i>main thread</i> is the thread that is executed when when your program begins. The main thread is
            important for two reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>It is the thread from which other "child" threads will be spawned.</li>
                <li>Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown
                    actions.

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Creating a Thread</div>
        <div>
            - You create a thread by instantiating an object of type <code>Thread</code>. This can be done in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li>You can implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface</li>
                <li>You can extend the <code>Thread</code> class itself</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="implementingRunnable" class="sub-heading">Implementing Runnable</div>
        <div>
            - The <code>Runnable</code> class should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be
            executed by a thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called <code>run</code>. <br>
            - Inside <code>run()</code> you will define the code that constitutes the new thread. After you create a
            class that implements <code>Runnable</code>, you will instantiate an object of type <code>Thread</code> from
            within that class. <br>
            - The <code>Thread</code> class defines many constructors. The one we use here is:
            <code>Thread(Runnable threadObj, String threadName)</code>. Here, <i>threadObj</i> is an instance of a class
            that implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. This defines where the execution of the thread will
            begin. The name of the new thread is specified by <i>threadName</i>. <br>
            - After the new thread is created, it will not start running unless you call its <code>start()</code>
            method. The <code>start()</code> method actually calls the <code>run()</code> method of the class that is
            referenced by <i>threadObj</i>. <br>

            <code>class PrimeRun implements Runnable {</code><br>
            <code> long minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> PrimeRun(long minPrime) {</code><br>
            <code> this.minPrime = minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>
            <code> public void run() {</code><br>
            <code> // compute primes larger than minPrime</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>
            <code>}</code><br>

            The following code would then create a thread and start it running: <br>
            <code>PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);</code><br>
            <code>new Thread(p).start();</code><br>
            <code>//or</code><br>
            <code>Thread t = new Thread(p);</code><br>
            <code>t.start();</code><br>

            - Passing <code>this</code> as the first argument indicates that you want the new thread to call the
            <code>run()</code> method on this object. Inside <code>main()</code>, <code>start()</code> is called, which
            starts the thread of execution beginning at the <code>run()</code> method. This causes the child thread's
            for loop to begin. Next the main thread enters its for loop. Both threads continue running, sharing the CPU
            in single-core systems, until their loops finish.

        <div class="sub-heading">Extending Thread</div>
        <div>
            - The second way to create a thread is to create a new class that extends <code>Thread</code>, and then to
            create an
            instance of that class. The extending class must override the <code>run()</code> method, which is the entry
            point for
            the new thread. As before, a call to <code>start()</code> begins execution of the new thread.
            <br>
            <code>class PrimeThread extends Thread {</code><br>
            <code> long minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> PrimeThread(long minPrime) {</code><br>
            <code> this.minPrime = minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>

            <code> public void run() {</code><br>
            <code> // compute primes larger than minPrime</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>
            <code>}</code><br>

            The following code would then create a thread and start it running: <br>
            <code>PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);</code><br>
            <code>p.start();</code>

                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8579657/whats-the-difference-between-thread-start-and-runnable-run">What's
            the difference between start() and run()</a>
            <br>
            - Well if you defined the <code>NewThread</code> class as: calling <code>run()</code> is literally
            going to call the <code>run()</code> method, like a
            literal method call. No new thread is going to be created. So in the <a href="#implementingRunnable">example
            above</a>, if you wrote <code>newThread.thread.run()</code> on Line 32, there would be a method call to the
            <code>run()</code> method. The <code>run()</code> method would finish executing. And only after that would
            the execution of the loop in te Main class even start. Only if you use the <code>start()</code> method is a
            new thread created and the code inside the <code>run()</code> method executed.
            <br>
            - Another difference between <code>start()</code> and <code>run()</code> in Java thread is that you can not
            call <code>start()</code> twice. Once started, second <code>start()</code> call will throw <code>IllegalStateException</code>
            in Java while you can call <code>run()</code> method several times since it's just an ordinary method.
            <br>

            should you use <code>Runnable</code> vs when should you use <code>Thread</code>?</a>.
            <br>
            - Almost always you will be using the <code>MyThread implements Runnable</code> interface to create a
            new thread.
            <br>
            - Classes should be extended only when they are being enhanced or adapted in some way. So, if you will not
            be overriding any of Thread's other methods, it is probably best simply to implement <code>Runnable</code>.
            Also, by implementing Runnable, your thread class does not need to inherit Thread, making it free to inherit
            a
            different class.

            <code>MyThread extends Thread</code> way of creating threads?</a>
            <br>
            - Because sometimes (almost never, but sometimes) you want to be able to change the basic behaviour of
            Thread. That's when you'll need to extend it. You can change it by overriding a method from the Thread
            class, you can't do it by implementing one from Runnable. <br>

        <div class="sub-heading">Creating Multiple Threads</div>
        <div>
            - Your program can spawn as many threads as you need.
            <br>
            - In the below example we are creating multiple threads. In the printout, note where the Main thread is
            exiting. It is not like Main is waiting for the other threads to end.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/f698e9f65e5b5f1ecf05416c93594f8e.js"></script>

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>isAlive()</code> and <code>join()</code></div>
        <div>
            - Look at the previous example. The main thread finished ealrier than the child threads. Often, you would
            want the main thread to finish last.
            <br>
            - Two ways exist to determine whether a thread has finished or not. First, you can call
            <code>isAlive()</code> on the thread which returns true if the thread is still running.
            <br>
            - But you should prefer the <code>join()</code> method. This method waits until the thread on which it is
            called terminates. It's name comes from the concept of the calling thread waiting until the specified thread
            joins it. <code>join</code> also allows you to specify a maximum amount of time that you want to
            wait for the specified thread to terminate.
            <ul>
                <li><code>void join()</code>: Waits for this thread to die.</li>
                <li><code>void join(long millis)</code>: Waits at most millis milliseconds for this thread to die.</li>
                <li><code>void join(long millis, int nanos)</code>: Waits at most millis milliseconds plus nanos
                    nanoseconds for this thread to die.
                </li>
            </ul>
            - In the below example, remember that the main thread that is calling <code>mt1.join</code> (and others)
            will wait for the <code>mt1</code> to finish. The <code>mt2</code> thread is running in parallel and is not
            affected by the <code>mt1</code> and <code>mt1.join()</code> method calls at all. <a

        <div class="sub-heading">Thread Priorities</div>
        <div>
            - Thread priority is just a hint to OS task scheduler and is dependent on the underlying OS. OS will try to
            allocate more resources to a high priority thread but it does not guarantee it. So if your program is
            dependent on thread priorities than you are in-turn binding your program to underlying OS, which is bad.
            <br>
            - From Java Concurrency in Practice: Avoid the temptation to use thread priorities, since they increase
            platform dependence and can cause liveness problems. Most concurrent applications can use the default
            priority for all threads. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20333255/8742428">Link to post on SO</a>

        <div class="sub-heading">Synchronization</div>
        <div>
            - When two or more threads need access to a shared resource, they need some way to ensure that the resource
            will be used by only one thread at a time. The process by which this is achieved is called synchronization.
            <br>
            - Key to synchronization is the concept of the monitor. A monitor is an object that is used as a mutually
            exclusive lock. Only one thread can own a monitor at a given time. When a thread acquires a lock, it is said
            to have entered the monitor. All other threads attempting to enter the locked monitor will be suspended
            until the first thread exits the monitor. These other threads are said to be waiting for the monitor. A
            thread that owns a monitor can reenter the same monitor if it so desires.
            <br>
            - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9848796/8742428">SO Link explaining what a monitor actually is</a>
            <br>
            - This is what happens when your code is NOT synchronized.
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/9a6fdb4fb951d6f65f123cd7141945b2.js"></script>
            - By calling <code>sleep()</code>, the <code>call()</code> method allows execution to switch to another
            thread. This results in the
            mixed-up output of the three message strings. In this program, nothing exists to stop all three threads from
            calling the same method, on the same object, at the same time. This is known as a race condition, because
            the three threads are racing each other to complete the method.
            <br>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>synchronized</code> methods</div>
        <div>
            - To prevent the above, you need to <i>serialize</i> the access to the <i>method</i> <code>call()</code>.
            That is, you must restrict its access to only one thread at a time. To do this, you simply need to precede
            <code>call()</code>'s definition with the keyword <code>synchronized</code>.
            <br>
            <code>class CallMe{</code>
            <br>
            <code> synchronized void callMe(){...}</code>
            <br>
            <code>}</code>
            <br>
            - This prevents other threads from entering the method <code>call()</code> when another thread is already
            using it. And after we make this change, we get the correct output:
            <br>
            [Hello]
            <br>
            [World]
            <br>
            [Synchronized]
            <br>
            Example of using the synchronized statement:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ab92d8351023dd755f7afb0668ab2192.js"></script>
            </div>
            Well we would have expected "Hello Synchronized World". But threads gonna thread I guess.
            <br>
            Any time that you have a method, or group of methods, that manipulates the internal state of an object in a
            multithreaded situation, you should use the <code>synchronized</code> keyword to guard the state from race
            conditions.
            Remember, once a thread enters any synchronized method on an instance, no other thread can enter any other
            synchronized method on the same instance. However, nonsynchronized methods on that instance will continue to
            be callable.

        <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>synchronized</code> Statements</div>
        <div>
            - Creating <code>synchronized</code> methods within classes might not always work.
            <br>
            - Imagine that you want to synchronize access to objects of a class that was not designed for multithreaded
            access. That is, the class does not use synchronized methods. Further, this class was not created by you,
            but by a third party, and you do not have access to the source code. Thus, you can't add synchronized to the
            appropriate methods within the class. How can access to an object of this class be synchronized?
            <br>
            - You put calls to the methods defined by the class inside a <code>synchronized</code> block.
            <br>
            - This is the general form of the <code>synchronized</code> statement:
            <br>
            <code>synchronized(objRef){</code>
            <br>
            <code> //Statements to be synchronized</code>
            <br>
            <code>}</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>objRef</code> is the reference to the object being synchronized. A synchronized block ensures
            that a call to a method that is a member of <code>objRef</code>'s class occurs only after the current thread
            has successfully entered <code>objRef</code>'s monitor.
            <br>
            - The previous example can then be rewritten in the following manner:

            - //TODO: Read up on what Polling is
            <br>
            - In Java , you have <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, and <code>notifyAll()</code> methods. These
            methods are implemented as <code>final</code> methods in <code>Object</code>, so all classes have them. All
            3 methods can be called only from within a <code>synchronized</code> context.
            <ul>
                <li><code>notify()</code>:
                    <br>
                    - Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If any
                    threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary
                    and occurs at the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's monitor by calling
                    one of the wait methods.
                    <br>
                    - The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on
                    this object. The awakened thread will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
                    be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the awakened thread enjoys no
                    reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object.
                    <br>
                    - This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. A thread
                    becomes the owner of the object's monitor in one of three ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.</li>
                        <li>By executing the body of a synchronized statement that synchronizes on the object.</li>
                        <li>For objects of type Class, by executing a synchronized static method of that class.</li>
                    </ul>
                    - Only one thread at a time can own an object's monitor.
                </li>
                <li><code>notifyAll</code>:
                    <br>
                    - Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. A thread
                    waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the wait methods.
                    The awakened threads will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on
                    this object. The awakened threads will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
                    be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the awakened threads enjoy no
                    reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object.
                    <br>
                    - This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. See the
                    notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>wait()</code>:
                    <br>
                    - Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method or the
                    notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed.
                    The current thread must own this object's monitor.
                    <br>
                    - This method causes the current thread (call it T) to place itself in the wait set for this object
                    and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread T becomes disabled
                    for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread T happens to be
                            arbitrarily
                            chosen as the thread to be awakened.
                        </li>
                        <li>Some other thread invokes the notifyAll method for this object.</li>
                        <li>Some other thread interrupts thread T.</li>
                        <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less. If timeout is zero, however,
                            then real
                            time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    - The thread T is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread
                    scheduling.
                    It then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object;
                    once it has gained control of the object, all its synchronization claims on the object are restored
                    to the status quo ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked.
                    Thread T then returns from the invocation of the wait method. Thus, on return from the wait method,
                    the synchronization state of the object and of thread T is exactly as it was when the wait method
                    was invoked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            - Code without using any kind of inter-thread communication: <br>
            - The problem with this code is that although the <code>put()</code> and <code>get()</code> methods on Q are
            synchronized, nothing is stopping the producer from overrunning the consumer, nor will anything stop the
            consumer from consuming the same queue value twice. Hence you get erroneous output.
            <div class="code-snippet">

            </div>

            - Code after using inter-thread communication: <br>
            - Inside <code>get()</code>, <code>wait()</code> is called. This causes it's execution to suspend until
            Producer notifies you that some data is ready. When this happens execution inside <code>get</code> resumes.
            After the data has been obtained <code>get</code> calls <code>notify</code>. This tells the producer that it
            is ok to put more data in the queue. Inside <code>put()</code>, <code>wait</code> suspends execution until
            Consumer has removed the item from the queue. When the execution resumes, the next item of data is out in
            the queue, and notify is called. This tells the Consumer that it should now remove it.

        <div class="sub-heading">Deadlock</div>
        <div>
            - A special type of error that you need to avoid that relates specifically to multitasking is deadlock,
            which occurs when two threads have a circular dependency on a pair of synchronized objects. For example,
            suppose one thread enters the monitor on object X and another thread enters the monitor on object Y. If the
            thread in X tries to call any synchronized method on Y, it will block as expected. However, if the thread in
            Y, in turn, tries to call any synchronized method on X, the thread waits forever, because to access X, it
            would have to release its own lock on Y so that the first thread could complete.
            - Code showing how Deadlock can be created:
            <br>
            - The next example creates two classes, A and B, with methods foo() and bar(), respectively, which pause
            briefly before trying to call a method in the other class. The main class, named Deadlock, creates an A and
            a B instance, and then calls deadlockStart() to start a second thread that sets up the deadlock condition.
            The foo() and bar() methods use sleep() as a way to force the deadlock condition to occur.

        <div class="sub-heading">Suspending, Resuming, and Stopping Threads</div>
        <div>
            - A thread must be designed so that the <code>run()</code> method periodically checks to determine whether
            that thread should suspend, resume, or stop its own execution.
            <br>
            - Typically, this is accomplished by establishing a flag variable that indicates the execution state of the
            thread. As long as this flag is set to "running," the <code>run()</code> method must continue to let the
            thread execute. If this variable is set to "suspend", the thread must pause. If it is set to "stop", the
            thread must terminate. Of course, a variety of ways exist in which to write such code, but the central theme
            will be the same for all programs.

        <div>
            - It is important to point out the distinction between traditional multithreading and parallel programming.
            <br>
            - In the past, most computers had a single CPU and multithreading was primarily used to take advantage of
            idle time, such as when a program is waiting for user input. Using this approach, one thread can execute
            while another is waiting. In other words, on a single-CPU system, multithreading is used to allow two or
            more tasks to share the CPU. This type of multithreading is typically supported by an object of type Thread
            (as described in Chapter 11). Although this type of multithreading will always remain quite useful, it was
            not optimized for situations in which two or more CPUs are available (multicore computers).
            <br>
            - When multiple CPUs are present, a second type of multithreading capability that supports true parallel
            execution is required. With two or more CPUs, it is possible to execute portions of a program
            simultaneously, with each part executing on its own CPU. This can be used to significantly speed up the
            execution of some types of operations, such as sorting, transforming, or searching a large array. In many
            cases, these types of operations can be broken down into smaller pieces (each acting on a portion of the
            array), and each piece can be run on its own CPU.
