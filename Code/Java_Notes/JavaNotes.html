        - There are 4 aspects of Object-Oriented programming (OOP): <br>
        a) Abstraction <br>
        b) Encapsulation (data-hiding using <code>private</code> members to access state of a class) <br>
        c) Inheritance <br>
        d) Polymorphism (says that - don't worry about the reference you have at hand. Go ahead and call the method and
        we will call the right method based on the true type of the object at runtime, and not the perceived type of the
        object at compile time) <br>
        - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8960918/encapsulation-vs-abstraction?">SO Link </a> that explains
        the difference betn Abstraction and Encapsulation. <br>

        <br>
        <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-composition-aggregation-association">What is Composition, Aggregation,
            and Association?</a><br>

        <li>
            <b>Composition</b>: Think of it as a "has-a" kind of relationship, compared to inheritance which is more of
            a "is-a" kind of relationship. For eg. a building <i>has a </i> room.
            Composition is a strong kind of "has-a" relationship because the containing object owns it. Therefore, the
            objects' lifecycles are tied. It means that if we destroy the owner object, its members also will be
            destroyed with it. So if we destroyed the building, the room would also be destroyed.
            In Java, we can model this with a non-static inner class: <br>
            <code>class Building {</code> <br>
            <code> class Room {}</code> <br>
            <code>}</code>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Aggregation</b>: Aggregation is also a "has-a" relationship. What distinguishes it from composition, that
            it doesn't involve owning. As a result, the lifecycles of the objects aren't tied: every one of them can
            exist independently of each other.
            In Java, we can model aggregation with a plain old reference: <br>
            <code>class Wheel {}</code> <br>
            <code>class Car {</code> <br>
            <code> List&lt;Wheel&gt wheels;</code> <br>
            <code>}</code>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Association:</b> Association is the weakest relationship between the three. It isn't a "has-a"
            relationship, none of the objects are parts or members of another. In Java, we can model association the
            same way as aggregation: <br>
            <code>class Child {}</code> <br>
            <code>class Mother {</code> <br>
            <code> List&lt;Child&gt children;</code> <br>
            <code>}</code> <br>

            How can we tell if a reference means aggregation or association?
            Well, we can't. The difference is only logical: whether one of the objects is part of the other or not.
        </li>

        - And then there is <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/61446">this SO link</a>. <br>

        <br>

        What is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> principle? <br>
        - Single-responsibility principle: A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to
        one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class. <br>
        - Open-closed principle: Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification. <br>
        - Liskov substitution principle: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
        without altering the correctness of that program.
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56860/what-is-an-example-of-the-liskov-substitution-principle">This
            SO Link</a> explains using examples what this actually means. <br>
        Check <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-method-overload-override#1-type-substitutability">this on
        Baeldung for a much clearer explanation</a>. It says: <br>
        It's valid to make an overridden method to accept arguments of different types and return a different type as
        well, but with full adherence to these rules: <br>
        a) If a method in the base class takes argument(s) of a given type, the overridden method should take the same
        type or a <i>supertype</i> (NOTE: It's supertype, NOT subtype) (a.k.a. <i>contravariant</i> method arguments).
        Refer
        <a href="../ThingsToRemember/ThingsToRemember.html#66.2">66.2</a> and <a
            href="../ThingsToRemember/ThingsToRemember.html#66.3">66.3</a>. <br>
        b) If a method in the base class returns <code>void</code>, the overridden method should return
        <code>void</code> <br>
        c) If a method in the base class returns a primitive, the overridden method should return the same primitive
        <br>
        d) If a method in the base class returns a certain type, the overridden method should return the same type or a
        <i>subtype</i> (NOTE: It's subtype, NOT supertype) (a.k.a. <i>covariant</i> return type). Refer <a
            href="../ThingsToRemember/ThingsToRemember.html#66.1">66.1</a>. <br>
        e) If a method in the base class throws an exception, the overridden method must throw the same exception or a
        subtype of the base class exception <br>

        - Interface segregation principle: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose
        interface.
        <br>
        - Dependency inversion principle: One should depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions. <br>

        <br><br>
        - A class that does the inheriting is called the <i>subclass</i> and the class that is inherited is called the
        <i>superclass</i>.
        Therefore, a subclass is a specialized version of the superclass and adds its own unique elements.
        <div class="sub-heading">Inheritance Basics</div>
        - class <i>subclass-name</i> extends <i>superclass-name</i>{
        <br>
        }
        <br>

        <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ba79d9022d2625127daa0f40896e3ceb.js"></script>
        </div>
        - You can only specify one super class for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance
        of multiple superclasses into a single subclass. What you can do is create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a
        subclass becomes a superclass of another subclass.

        <div class="sub-heading">Member Access and Inheritance</div>
        - Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of its
        superclass that have been declared as <code>private</code>. A member declared as <code>private</code> is ONLY
        accessible by other members of its own class. These members are not accessible by any code outside of its class,
        not even by its subclasses.

        <div id="superclass_reference" class="sub-heading">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</div>
        <div>
            A reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is
            important to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that
            it refers to - that determines what members can be accessed.</i> That is when a reference to a subclass
            object is assigned to a superclass reference variable, you will have access to only those parts of the
            object defined by the superclass.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8d3f3665ec70aced023563b5888d2f20.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Understanding super</div>
        <div>
            <code>super</code> has two general forms. The first calls the superclass' constructor. The second is used to
            access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">a) Using super to call superclass constructors</div>
        <div>
            A subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass by use of the following form of
            <code>super</code>:
            <code>super(<i>arg-list</i>)</code>
            <br>
            Here <i>arg-list</i> specifies any arguments needed by the constructor in the superclass.
            <code>super()</code> must also always be the first statement that is executed inside a subclass'
            constructor.
            <br>
            - Since constructors can be overloaded, <code>super()</code> can be called using any form defined by the
            superclass. The constructor executed will be the one that matches the arguments.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7239243bccc65ce54f32df1b7248e120.js"></script>
            </div>
            Notice that <code>super()</code> is passed an object of type <code>BoxWeight</code> - not of type
            <code>Box</code>. This still
            invokes the constructor <code>Box(Box obj)</code>. As mentioned earlier, a superclass variable can be used
            to
            reference any object derived from that class. Thus we are able to pass a <code>BoxWeight</code> object to
            the <code>Box</code> constructor.
            <br>
            - So this is the key concept behind <code>super()</code>: when a subclass calls <code>super()</code>, it is
            calling the constructor of its immediate superclass. Thus <code>super()</code> always refers to the
            superclass immediately above the calling class. Also, <code>super()</code> must always be the first
            statement executed inside a subclass constructor (that is IF you are using a <code>super()</code>).
            <br>
            - Remember that if you are calling the constructor of the subclass, and that constructor does not contain a
            <code>super()</code>, the default no-args constructor of the superclass will be called. If the superclass
            does not have the
            default constructor, the code will not compile (recall that default constructor is present in every class,
            but if you are

            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34488484/why-is-super-class-constructor-always-called?lq=1">Why
                is the superclass constructor always called</a>
            <br>
            - The constructors of the parent classes are called, all the way up the class hierarchy through
            <code>Object</code>, before the child class's constructor is called.
            <br>
            -With <code>super()</code>, the superclass no-argument constructor is called.
            With <code>super(parameter-list)</code>, the superclass constructor with a matching parameter list is
            called.
            Note: If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a
            superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the
            superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error.
            <code>Object</code> does have such a constructor, so if <code>Object</code> is the only superclass, there is
            no problem.
            If a subclass constructor invokes a constructor of its superclass, either explicitly or implicitly, you
            might think that there will be a whole chain of constructors called, all the way back to the constructor of
            <code>Object</code>. In fact, this is the case. It is called constructor chaining, and you need to be aware
            of it when there is
            a long line of class descent.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">b) A second use of super</div>
        <div>
            The second form of <code>super</code> acts somewhat like <code>this</code>, except that it always refers to
            the
            superclass of the subclass in which it is used. The usage has the following general form: <code>super.<i>member</i></code>.
            Here
            <i>member</i> can be either a method or instance variable. This second form of <code>super</code> is most
            applicable to situations in which
            member names of a subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass.

        <div class="sub-heading">Creating a MultiLevel Hierarchy</div>
        <div>
            You can build hierarchies that contain as many layers of inheritance as you like. Because of inheritance,
            Shipment can make use of the previously defined classes of BoxWeight and Box, adding only the extra
            information that it needs for its own, specific application.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1fb9bc209d80caa7011327b0bf7f17b.js"></script>
            </div>
            This example illustrates an important point - <code>super</code> always refers to the constructor in the
            closest
            superclass. The <code>super()</code> in Shipment calls the constructor in BoxWeight. The
            <code>super()</code> in BoxWeight calls the constructor in Box.
            <br>
            - In a class hierarchy, if a superclass constructor requires arguments, then all subclasses must pass those
            arguments "up the line". This is true whether or not a subclass needs an argument of its own. <br>
            - This is another example: the question was - given an abstract class Car, with one abstract method
            getMileage, create 2 classes that extend the class.

        <div class="sub-heading">When Constructors are Executed</div>
        <div>
            -In a class hierarchy, constructors complete their execution in the order of derivation, from superclass to
            subclass. Further, since <code>super()</code> must be the first statement that is executed in a subclass'
            constructor, this order is the same whether or not <code>super()</code> is used. If <code>super()</code> is
            not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of each superclass will be executed.

        <div class="sub-heading">Behavior in the case of parameterized constructors</div>
        <div>
            - Note the example below. The <i>Child</i> class is inheriting from the <i>Parent</i> class. <br>
            - We have already seen that in the case of inheritance, the constructor of the parent class is called first. <br>
            - Hence, in the first case, the call to the non-parameterized constructor of the <i>Child</i> class first calls the non-parameterized constructor of the <i>Parent</i>
            class. That is the expected behavior. <br>
            - Note the second case carefully: the call to the parameterized constructor of the <i>Child</i> class calls the non-parameterized constructor of the <i>Parent</i>
            class. This would not change even if you changed the code to include the call to <code>super</code> in the constructor for the <i>Child</i> class. <br>
            - In order to call the parameterized constructor of the child class, you would have to explicitly call the parameterized version of the <code>super</code> method, as
            shown in the third constructor. Ignore the difference of the two args that are being passed, that is only because we cannot create two constructors with the same set of
            args.

        <div class="sub-heading">Method Overriding</div>
        <div>
            In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass, then the
            method in the subclass is said to <i>override</i> the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is
            called from
            within its subclass, it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass. The version
            of the method
            defined by the superclass will be hidden.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0db84861d6a4b08c62815ce370f217df.js"></script>
            </div>
            Remember that method overriding occurs ONLY when the names AND the type signatures are identical. Otherwise
            the two methods are simply overloaded.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Dynamic Method Dispatch</div>
        <div>
            Method Overriding provides the basis for Java's: <i>Dynamic Method Dispatch</i>. Dynamic method dispatch is
            the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than compile time.
            Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how
            Java implements run-time polymorphism. The basis for Dynamic Method Dispatch just that: a superclass
            reference variable can refer to a
            subclass object. Java uses this fact to resolve calls to overridden methods. This is how it is done: when an
            overridden method
            is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method to execute based upon
            the type
            of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is made at runtime.
            When different types
            of objects are referred to, different versions of an overridden method will be called.
            <br>
            - In other words: <i>it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable)
            that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.</i> Therefore, if a superclass
            contains
            a method that is overridden by a subclass, then when different types of objects are referred to through a
            superclass
            reference variable, different versions of the method are executed. Compare this with what we read in
            <a href="#superclass_reference">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</a>" section: A
            reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is
            important to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that
            it
            refers to - that determines what members can be accessed</i>.
            <div class="code-snippet">

        <div>
            - Another example that makes more sense is the <code>List</code> interface, and the <code>ArrayList</code>
            and <code>LinkedList</code> classes.
            <br>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14903145/what-is-the-difference-between-list-and-arraylist">What

            </div>
            - There's no difference between list implementations in both of your examples. There's however a difference
            in a way you can further use variable myList in your code.
            When you define your list as in Line 1, you can only call methods and reference members that are defined in
            the List interface.
            When you define your list as in Line 2, you'll be able to invoke ArrayList-specific methods and use
            ArrayList-specific members
            in addition to those whose definitions are inherited from List.
            <br>
            - Nevertheless, when you call a method of a List interface in the first example, which was implemented in
            ArrayList, the method
            from ArrayList will be called (because the List interface doesn't implement any methods). That's called
            polymorphism. You can read up on it.
            <br>
            - The definition in Line 1 should always be preferred. Why though?
            <br>
            Almost always <code>List</code> is preferred over <code>ArrayList</code> because, for instance,
            <code>List</code> can be
            translated into a <code>LinkedList</code> without
            affecting the rest of the codebase. The only change that we will have to make in the codebase is change the
            Line1 to <code>new LinkedList&lt;SomeObject&gt()</code>.
            When you do, in fact, have to use methods that are specific ONLY to <code>ArrayList</code>, you can convert
            <code>List</code>
            to <code>ArrayList</code> very easily.
            Most common error is to accidentally use an ArrayList method, without that being necessary. Changing
            ArrayList to List or another List implementation is difficult.
            Something to note is that "ArrayList specific methods" isn't limited to just methods used in ArrayList, but
            their return types being changed as well.
            <br>
            - Occasionally, the application may require that you use methods in the ArrayList API that are not in the
            List API. For example,
            <code>ensureCapacity(int)</code>, <code>trimToSize()</code> or <code>removeRange(int, int)</code>. That is
            the only sound reason for coding to the class rather than the interface, <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279030/type-list-vs-type-arraylist-in-java">IMO</a>.
            <br>
            The above argument also holds for methods that operate on sets or return sets. They should specify
            parameters of type Set:

                SO post discussing the same thing</a>
            <br>
            Effective Java (Bloch): If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, and fields
            should all be declared using interface types.
            If you get into the habit of using interface types, your program will be much more flexible. It is entirely
            appropriate to refer to an
            object by a class if no appropriate interface exists.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">When will overriding methods not work</div>
        <div>
            - The methods that are overriding each other MUST have the same return type. If the return type is different, then the two methods neither override nor overload each
            other. <br>
            - However, the overriding method of the subclass CAN return an object that is the subclass of the object that is being returned from the superclass method that is being
            overridden. Doesn't make sense? Look at the below example:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/974d88b9a0c80a4178b46ebfea69e5e8.js"></script>
            </div>
            - Second, when overriding a method, we can increase access but we can never decrease access. Java specifies that the access specifier for an overriding method can allow
            more, but not less, access than the overridden method. For example, a <code>protected</code> instance method in the superclass can be made <code>public</code>, but not
            <code>private</code>, in the subclass.

        <div class="sub-heading">Using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods</div>
        <div>
            - You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the <code>abstract</code> type modifier.These methods are sometimes referred to as
            <i>subclasser responsibility</i> because these methods have no implementation specified in the superclass. Hence, a subclass MUST override them - it cannot simply use
            the version defined in the superclass. To declare an abstract method, use this general form: <code>abstract <i>type name (parameter-list);</i> </code>
            <br>
            Note the closing semi-colon. No method body is present. Abstract methods CANNOT have a body. Abstract classes can have concrete methods along with abstract methods
            though.
            <br>
            - Any class that contains one or more abstract methods MUST also be declared abstract. There can be no objects of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class cannot
            be instantiated using a <code>new</code> operator. Also, you cannot declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods. Any subclass of an abstract method must
            either implement all of the abstract methods or be declared <code>abstract</code> itself. <br>
            - Abstract classes/methods cannot be declared <code>final</code>. Abstract classes/methods cannot be declared <code>static</code> <br>
            - Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object references. <br>
            - To declare a class abstract, we use the <code>extends</code> keyword. Note that abstract classes are <i>extended</i> whereas interfaces are <i>implemented</i>.

        <div>
            - The keyword <code>final</code> has 3 uses - the first is in creating a named constant. The other 2 uses of <code>final</code> apply to inheritance.

            <div class="sub-heading">a) Using final to prevent Overriding</div>
            <div>
                - To disallow a method from being overridden, specify <code>final</code> as a modifier at the start of its declaration. Methods declared as <code>final</code>
                cannot be overridden. <br>
                - Methods declared as <code>final</code> can sometimes also provide performance enhancement by <i>inlining</i> calls to them. Normally, Java resolves calls to
                methods dynamically at run-time. This is called <i>late-binding</i>. However, since <code>final</code> methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved
                at compile time. This is called <i>early-binding</i>.

            <div>
                - Sometimes, you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class
                declaration with <code>final</code>. Declaring a class as <code>final</code> implicitly declares all of
                its methods as <code>final</code> too.
                <br>
                - As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both <code>abstract</code> and
                <code>final</code> (since
                an abstract class is incomplete by itself and relies upon its subclasses to provide complete

            - The <code>equals()</code> method compares two objects. It returns <code>true</code> if the objects are
            equal,
            and <code>false</code> otherwise. The precise definition of equality can differ depending on the types of
            objects
            being compared.
            <br>
            - The <code>toString()</code> method returns a string that contains a description of the object on which it

            called. Also, this method is automatically called when an object is output using <code>println()</code>.
            Many classes

            that they create.

    <div class="textual-content">
        - Interfaces are syntactically similar to classes, but they lack instance variables. In practice, this means
        that you can define interfaces that don't make assumptions about how they are implemented. Once it is defined,
        any number of classes can implement an interface. Also, one class can implement any number of interfaces. <br>
        - Interfaces are designed to support dynamic method resolution at run time. Since interfaces are in a different
        hierarchy from classes, it is possible for classes that are unrelated in terms of the class hierarchy to
        implement the same interface. This is where the real power of interfaces is realized.

        <div class="sub-heading">Defining an Interface</div>
        <div>
            - When no access modifier is included, then default access results, and the interface is only available to
            other members of the package in which it is declared. When it is declared as <code>public</code>, the
            interface can be used by code outside its package. In this case, the interface must be the only public
            interface declared in the file, and the file must have the same name as the interface. <br>
            - Notice that the methods that are declared have no bodies. Beginning with JDK 8, it is possible to add a
            default implementation to an interface method. Furthermore, JDK 8 also added static interface methods, and
            beginning with JDK 9, an interface can include private methods. <br>
            - Variables can be declared inside interface declarations. They are implicitly <code>final</code> and <code>static</code>,
            meaning they cannot be changed by the implementing class. They must also be initialized. All methods and
            variables are implicitly <code>public</code>.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/90194e752fe075066d8fefa19a1c6890.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Implementing Interfaces</div>
        <div>
            - Once an interface has been defined, one or more classes can implement that interface. To implement an
            interface, include the <code>implements</code> clause in a class definition, and then create the methods
            required by the interface. <br>
            - The general form of a class that includes the <code>implements</code> clause looks like this: <br>
            <code>class <i>className</i> [extends <i>superclassName</i>] implements <i>interface1, interface2</i></code>
            <code>{</code> <br>
            <code> // class methods</code> <br>
            <code>}</code> <br>
            - If a class implements more than one interface, the interfaces are separated with a comma. <br>
            - So what happens if a class implements two different interfaces and both of those interfaces happen to have
            the same method name with the same method signature? <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2801878/implementing-two-interfaces-in-a-class-with-same-method-which-interface-method">Source
            on SO</a>. Read both top 2 answers. <br>
            - The methods that implement an interface must be declared public. Also, the type signature of the
            implementing method must match exactly the type signature specified in the interface definition. <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/81db928204fd2950e86886bd4547d060.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Accessing implementations through Interface references</div>
        <div>
            - Consider a Teacher class that implements the IPerson interface. <br>
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/decb62c60c0ef9b6b02c77b994bc5703.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Then the typical polymorphic properties work with interfaces as well:

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b3c93068ad88db2b7eec1017b2ccdea1.js"></script>
            </div>
            - If a class implements an interface but does not fully implement the methods required by that interface,
            then
            that class must be declared as <code>abstract</code>. Any class that inherits this abstract class must
            implement the methods in the interface or be declared <code>abstract</code> itself.
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Nested Interfaces</div>
        <div>
            - An interface can be declared a member of a class or another interface. Such an interface is called a
            member interface or a nested interface. A nested interface can be declared as <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>,
            or <code>protected</code>.
            This differs from a top-level interface, which must either be declared as <code>public</code> or use the
            default access level, as previously described. When a nested interface is used outside of its enclosing
            scope, it must be qualified by the name of the class or interface of which it is a member. Thus, outside of
            the class or interface in which a nested interface is declared, its name must be fully qualified. <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/f25d17a11921eedba6449e14d90d126e.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Variables in Interfaces</div>
        <div>
            - You can use interfaces to import shared constants into multiple classes by simply declaring an interface
            that contains variables that are initialized to the desired values. When you include that interface in a
            class (that is, when you "implement" the interface), all of those variable names will be in scope as
            constants. If an interface contains no methods, then any class that includes such an interface doesn't
            actually implement anything. It is as if that class were importing the constant fields into the class name
            space as final variables. <br>
            - But usage of constants in interfaces is controversial. Oh my! <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2659593/what-is-the-use-of-interface-constants">Here on SO</a>.
            <div class="code-snippet">

            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Interface can be extended</div>
        <div>
            - One interface can inherit another by use of the keyword extends. The syntax is the same as for inheriting
            classes. When a class implements an interface that inherits another interface, it must provide
            implementations for all methods required by the interface inheritance chain.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b17a5347d66147567a8fe7377e30af32.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Default interface methods</div>
        <div>
            - It is important to point out that the addition of default methods does not change a key aspect of
            interface: its inability to maintain state information. An interface still cannot have instance variables,
            for example. Thus, the defining difference between an interface and a class is that a class can maintain
            state information, but an interface cannot. Furthermore, it is still not possible to create an instance of
            an interface by itself. It must be implemented by a class. Therefore, even though, beginning with JDK 8, an
            interface can define default methods, the interface must still be implemented by a class if an instance is
            to be created. <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/179654c3e0db7c1ca24e94122063b45d.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Multiple inheritance issues</div>
        <div>
            - Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. <br>
            - For example, assume that two interfaces called Alpha and Beta are implemented by a class called MyClass.
            What happens if both Alpha and Beta provide a method called reset() for which both declare a default
            implementation? Is the version by Alpha or the version by Beta used by MyClass? Or, consider a situation in
            which Beta extends Alpha. Which version of the default method is used? Or, what if MyClass provides its own
            implementation of the method? To handle these and other similar types of situations, Java defines a set of
            rules that resolves such conflicts. <br>
            - First, in all cases, a class implementation takes priority over an interface default implementation. Thus,
            if MyClass provides an override of the reset( ) default method, MyClass' version is used. This is the case
            even if MyClass implements both Alpha and Beta. In this case, both defaults are overridden by MyClass'
            implementation. <br>
            - Second, in cases in which a class implements two interfaces that both have the same default method, but
            the class does not override that method, then an error will result. Continuing with the example, if MyClass
            implements both Alpha and Beta, but does not override reset(), then an error will occur. <br>
            - In cases in which one interface inherits another, with both defining a common default method, the
            inheriting interface's version of the method takes precedence. Therefore, continuing the example, if Beta
            extends Alpha, then Beta's version of reset() will be used. <br>
            - It is possible to explicitly refer to a default implementation in an inherited interface by using this
            form of <code>super</code>. Its general form is shown here: <code>InterfaceName.super.methodName() </code>.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/cf86eb7513b317e11259873aa731edd2.js"></script>
            </div>

        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Using static methods in an interface</div>
        <div>
            - Another capability added to interface by JDK 8 is the ability to define one or more <code>static</code>
            methods. Like <code>static</code> methods in a class, a <code>static</code> method defined by an interface
            can be called independently of any object. Thus, no implementation of the interface is necessary, and no
            instance of the interface is required, in order to call a static method. Instead, a static method is called
            by specifying the interface name, followed by a period, followed by the method name. <br>
            - <code>static</code> interface methods are not inherited by either an implementing class or a subinterface.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Private interface methods</div>
        <div>
            - Beginning with JDK 9, an interface can include a private method. A private interface method can be called
            only by a default method or another private method defined by the same interface. Because a private
            interface method is specified private, it cannot be used by code outside the interface in which it is
            defined. This restriction includes subinterfaces because a private interface method is not inherited by a
            subinterface. <br>
            - The key benefit of a private interface method is that it lets two or more default methods use a common
            piece of code, thus avoiding code duplication.

                - ArrayList has 3 constructors:
                <br>
                a) <code>ArrayList()</code>: Builds an empty Array List
                <br>
                b) <code>ArrayList(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt c)</code>: Builds an Array List that is initialized with
                the
                elements of the Collection c in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.
                <br>
                c) <code>ArrayList(int capacity)</code>: Builds an array list that has the specified initial capacity.
                The
                capacity is the size of the
                underlying array that is used to store the elements. The capacity grows automatically as elements are
                added to the array list.
                <br>
                You can increase the capacity of an ArrayList object manually by calling <code>ensureCapacity()</code>
                <br>

                    is going on?</a>
                <code>ensureCapacity</code> doesn't change the logical size of an ArrayList - it changes the <code>capacity</code>,
                which is the size the list can reach
                before it next needs to copy values. You need to be very aware of the difference between a logical size
                (i.e. all the
                values in the range [0, size) are accessible, and adding a new element will add it at index size) and
                the capacity
                which is more of an implementation detail really - it's the size of the backing array used for storage.
                <br>
                Calling <code>ensureCapacity</code> should only ever make any difference in terms of performance (by
                avoiding
                excessive copying) -
                it doesn't affect the logical model of what's in the list, if you see what I mean.

                to store the node information.
                To be clear, even in the worst case, ArrayList is 4x smaller than a LinkedList with the same elements.
                In short, it's basically impossible
                to make LinkedList win the memory comparison, and if you care about space, then calling
                <code>trimToSize()</code> on the ArrayList will instantly

                it can be as much as 6 times.) The only situation where a linked list will use less space than an array
                list is if
                you badly over-estimate the array list's initial capacity. (And for very small lists ...).
                When you think about it, the only real advantage linked lists have over array lists is when you are
                inserting and removing elements.

            <code>HashSet</code> extends <code>AbstractSet</code> and implements the <code>Set</code> interface. It
            creates a collection
            that uses a hash table for storage.
            <code>HashSet</code> is a generic class that has this declaration: <code>class HashSet&lt;E&gt</code>.
            <br>
            - This class implements the <code>Set</code> interface, backed by a hash table (actually a
            <code>HashMap</code>
            instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set;
            in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. This class permits the
            null element.
            This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>,
            <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
            assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly
            among the buckets.
            <br>
            - Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of the HashSet instance's size (the number
            of elements) plus the "capacity" of the backing
            <code>HashMap</code> instance (the number of buckets). Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
            capacity
            too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.
            <br>
            The following constructors are defined:
            <br>
            a) <code>HashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has default initial
            capacity
            (16) and load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            b) <code>HashSet(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt c)</code>: Initializes the hash set by using the elements of
            c.
            <br>
            c) <code>HashSet(int capacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has the
            specified
            initial capacity and default load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            d) <code>HashSet(int capacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap
            instance
            has the specified initial capacity and the specified load factor (also called fillRatio)

            The <code>LinkedHashSet</code> class extends <code>HashSet</code> and adds no members of its own. It is a
            generic class
            that has this declaration:
            <code>class LinkedHashSet&lt;E&gt</code>. Here, <code>E</code> specifies the type of objects that the set
            will hold. Its
            constructors parallel those in HashSet. Hash table and
            linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order. This implementation
            differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked
            list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is the order
            in which elements were inserted into the set (insertion-order).
            Note that insertion order is not affected if an element is re-inserted into the set.
            <br>
            (//TODO: But this should again run into the same problem that happens when we compare Linked List vs Array
            List. Linked Lists take way more memory. So I think LinkedHashSet should also end up taking an enormous
            chunk of memory )
            <br>
            Like HashSet, it provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>,
            <code>remove</code>,
            <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
            assuming the hash function disperses elements properly
            among the buckets.
            <br>
            - Performance is likely to be just slightly below that of HashSet, due to the added expense
            of maintaining the linked list, with one exception:
            Iteration over a LinkedHashSet requires time proportional to the <code>size</code> of the set, regardless of
            its
            <code>capacity</code>. Iteration over a HashSet is
            likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its capacity. This implementation spares its
            clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic
            ordering provided by HashSet, without incurring the increased cost associated with <code>TreeSet</code>.
            <br>
            Linked Hash Set has 4 Constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>LinkedHashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the default initial capacity
            (16) and load
            factor (0.75).
            <br>
            b) <code>LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the
            specified initial capacity and the default load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            c) <code>LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash
            set with the
            specified initial capacity and load factor.
            <br>
            d) <code>LinkedHashSet(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt c)</code>: Constructs a new linked hash set with the
            same elements as
            the specified collection.

            A <code>NavigableSet</code> implementation based on a <code>TreeMap</code>. The elements are ordered using
            their natural
            ordering, or by a <code>Comparator</code> provided at
            set creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed
            <i>log(n)</i> time cost for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code> and
            <code>contains</code>).
            Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent
            with equals</i> if it is to correctly implement
            the <i>Set</i> interface. (See <code>Comparable</code> or <code>Comparator</code> for a precise definition
            of consistent
            with equals.) This is so because the <code>Set</code>
            interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a <code>TreeSet</code> instance performs all
            element
            comparisons using its <code>compareTo</code> (or <code>compare</code>) method,
            so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the set, equal. The
            behavior of a set is well-defined even if its ordering is
            inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Set interface.
            <br>
            <code>TreeSet</code> has the following Constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>TreeSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted in ascending order according to the
            natural ordering
            of its elements.
            <br>
            b) <code>TreeSet(Collection&lt; extends E&gt c)</code> : Constructs a new tree set containing the elements
            in the
            specified collection, sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements.
            <br>
            c) <code>TreeSet(Comparator&lt;? super E&gt comparator)</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted
            according to the
            specified comparator.
            <br>
            d) <code>TreeSet(SortedSet&lt;E&gt s)</code>: Constructs a new tree set containing the same elements and
            using the same
            ordering as the specified sorted set.

            - Iterators allow you to cycle through the elements in a collection. <code>iterator</code> allows you to
            cycle through a collection, obtaining and removing elements. <code>ListIterator</code> extends <code>Iterator</code>
            to
            allow bi-directional traversal of a list, and the modification of elements.
            <br>
            - The <code>Iterator</code> and the <code>ListIterator</code> are generic interfaces:
            <br>
            <code>interface Iterator &lt;E&gt</code>
            <br>
            <code>interface ListIterator &lt;E&gt</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>E</code> specifies the type of object being iterated.

        <div class="sub-heading">Using an Iterator</div>
        <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
            Before you can access a collection through an iterator, you must obtain one. Each of the collection classes
            provides an
            <code>iterator()</code> method that returns an iterator to the start of the collection. By using this
            iterator
            object, you can access each element
            in the collection, one element at a time. In general, to use an iterator to cycle through the contents of a
            collection, follow these steps:
            <br>
            1. Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling the collection's <code>iterator()</code>
            method.
            <br>
            2. Set up a loop that makes a call to <code>hasNext()</code>. Have the loop iterate as long as <code>hasNext()</code>
            returns true.
            <br>
            3. Within the loop, obtain each element by calling <code>next()</code>.
            <br>
            For collections that implement List, you can also obtain an iterator by calling <code>listIterator()</code>.
            A list iterator gives you the ability to access the collection in either the forward or backward direction
            and lets you modify an element.
            Otherwise, <code>ListIterator</code> is used just like <code>Iterator</code>.

            - A <i>map</i> is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or <i>key/value</i> pairs.
            Given a key, you can find its value.
            Both keys and values are objects. The keys must be unique, but the values may be duplicated. Some maps can
            accept a null key and null values, others cannot.
            <br>
            - <code>Map</code> is generic and is declared as shown here: <code>interface Map &lt;K, V&gt</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>K</code> specifies the types of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the types of values.
            <br>
            - There is one key point about maps that is important to mention at the outset: they don't implement the
            <code>Iterable</code>
            interface.
            This means that you cannot cycle through a map using a for-each style for loop. Furthermore, you can't
            obtain an iterator to a map.
            However, you can obtain a collection-view of a map, which does allow the use of either the for loop or an
            iterator.
            <br>
            - The Map interface provides three <i>collection</i> views:
            <br>
            a) <code>Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt&gt entrySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the mappings
            contained in this
            map. The
            set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is
            modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove()
            operation,
            or through the setValue() operation on a map entry
            returned by the iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
            which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll,
            retainAll and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.
            <br>
            b) <code>Set&lt;K&gt keySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the keys contained in this map.
            <br>
            c) <code>Collection&lt;V&gt values()</code>: Returns a <code>Collection</code> view of the values contained
            in this map.
            <br>
            What's up with the 3 different return types?
            <br>

            <br>
            You should be careful about not changing the map while you are iterating over it. Read what it means to
            "change" the map on these SO links <a

            - The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views
            return their elements.
            Some map implementations, like the <code>TreeMap</code> class, make specific guarantees as to their order;
            others,
            like the <code>HashMap</code> class, do not.
            <br>
            - Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys. The behavior of a map is not
            specified if the value of an object is
            changed in a manner that affects <code>equals</code> comparisons while the object is a key in the map. A
            special
            case of this prohibition is that it is
            not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is permissible for a map to contain itself as
            a value, extreme caution is advised:
            the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods are no longer well defined on such a map.
            <br>
            - To put a value into a map, use <code>put(K key, V value)</code> specifying the key and the value.
            <code>get(Object key)</code> returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map
            contains
            no mapping for the key.

            - The <code>SortedMap</code> interface extends <code>Map</code>. It ensures that entries are maintained in
            the ascending
            order according to their keys.
            - The map is ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a <code>Comparator</code>
            typically
            provided at sorted map creation time.
            This order is reflected when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
            <code>entrySet()</code>, <code>keySet()</code> and <code>values()</code> methods).
            (This interface is the map analogue of SortedSet.)
            <br>
            - <code>SortedMap</code> is generic and is declared here: <code>interface SortedMap&lt;K, V&gt</code>. Here
            <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            - All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface (or be accepted
            by the
            specified comparator).
            Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable: <i>k1.compareTo(k2)</i> (or <i>comparator.compare(k1,
            k2)</i>) must not throw a

            - Sorted maps allow very efficient manipulations of submaps (in other words, subsets of a map). To obtain a
            submap, use
            <code>headMap()</code>, <code>tailMap()</code>, or <code>subMap()</code>. The submap returned by these
            methods is backed by
            the invoking map.
            Changing one changes the other. To get the first key in the set, call <code>firstKey()</code>. To get the
            last
            key, use <code>lastKey()</code>.

            The NavigableMap interface extends <code>SortedMap</code> and declares the behavior of a map that supports
            the
            retrieval of entries based on the closest match to a given key or keys.
            <br>
            - <code>NavigableMap</code> is a generic interface that has
            this declaration: <code>interface NavigableMap&lt;K,V&gt</code>. Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of
            the
            keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of the values associated with the keys.

            - The <code>Map.Entry</code> interface enables you to work with a map entry. For example, recall that the
            <code>entrySet()</code>
            method declared by the <code>Map</code> interface returns a <code>Set</code> containing the map entries.
            Each of these
            set elements is a <code>Map.Entry</code> object.
            <br>
            - <code>Map.Entry</code> is generic and is declared like this: <code>interface Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt</code>.
            Here <code>K</code>
            specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of Values.
            <br>
            - Map.Entry is a key and its value combined into one class. This allows you to iterate over <code>Map.entrySet()</code>
            instead of having to iterate over <code>Map.keySet()</code>, then getting the value for each key.

            The <code>HashMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>Map</code>
            interface. It uses a hash table to store the map. This allows the execution time of <code>get()</code> and
            <code>put()</code> to remain constant even for large sets. Remember that the <code>put()</code> method
            automatically replaces any preexisting value that is associated with the specified key with the new value.
            <code>HashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
            <br>
            <code>class HashMap&lt;K, V&gt</code>. Here <code>K</code> specifies the type of the key, and <code>V</code>specifies
            the type of the Value.
            <br>
            The following Constructors are defined:
            <br>
            a) <code>HashMap</code>: Constructs a default Hash Map
            <br>
            b) <code>HashMap(Map &lt;? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes the Hash Map by using the
            elements of m
            <br>
            c) <code>HashMpa(int capacity)</code>: Initializes the capacity of the Hash map to <i>capacity</i>.
            <br>
            d) <code>HashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: Initializes both the <i>capacity</i> and the <i>fillRatio</i>
            by using the arguments.

            The <code>TreeMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>NavigableMap</code>
            interface. It creates maps stored in a tree structure. A <code>TreeMap</code> provides an efficient means of
            storing
            key/value pairs in sorted order and allows rapid retrieval. You should note that, unlike a hash map, a tree
            map guarantees that its elements will be sorted in ascending key order. <code>TreeMap</code> is a generic
            class that has
            this declaration: <code>class TreeMap&lt;K, V&gt</code> Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and
            <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            The <code>TreeMap</code> constructors are:
            <br>
            a) <code>TreeMap</code>: Constructs an empty tree map that will be sorted by using the natural order of its
            keys.
            <br>
            b) <code>TreeMap(Comparator &lt;? super K&gt comp)</code>: Constructs an empty tree-based map that will be
            sorted by using the
            <code>Comparator</code> comp.
            <br>
            c) <code>TreeMap(Map &lt;? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries
            from
            m, which will be sorted by using the natural order of the keys.
            <br>
            d) <code>TreeMap(SortedMap &ltK, ? extends V &gt sm)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries from
            <i>sm</i>, which will be sorted in the same order as <i>sm</i>.
            <br>
            Notice that <code>TreeMap</code> sorts the keys. However, in this case, they are sorted by first name
            instead of last name. You can alter this behavior by specifying a comparator when the map is created.

            <code>LinkedHashMap</code> extends <code>HashMap</code>. It maintains a linked list of the entries in the
            map, in the order in which they were inserted. This allows insertion-order iteration over the map. That is,
            when iterating through a collection-view of a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, the elements will be returned in
            the order in
            which they were inserted. You can also create a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> that returns its elements in the
            order in
            which they were last accessed.
            <br>
            <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
            <code>class LinkedHashMap&ltK,V&gt</code>.
            Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            LinkedHashMap defines the following constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>LinkedHashMap()</code>: Constructs a default Linked Hash Map
            <br>
            b) <code>LinkedHashMap(Map&lt? extends K, ? extends V&gt m)</code>: initializes the LinkedHashMap with the
            elements from <i>m</i>.
            <br>
            c) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity)</code>: initializes the capacity.
            <br>
            d) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: initializes both capacity and fill ratio. The
            meaning of capacity and fill ratio are the same as for HashMap. The default capacity is 16. The default
            ratio is 0.75.
            <br>
            e) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio, boolean Order)</code>: allows you to specify whether
            the elements will be stored in the linked list by insertion order, or by order of last access. If
            <i>Order</i> is
            true, then access order is used. If <i>Order</i> is false, then insertion order is used.

        <div class="sub-heading">What is a Lambda Expression</div>
        <div>
            - A Lambda Expression is an unnamed block of code with a list of formal parameters and a body. An arrow
            <code>-></code> is used to separate the list of the parameters and the <i>body</i> of the lambda expression.
            <br>
            - A Lambda Expression represents an <i>instance</i> of a <i>functional interface</i>. Every expression in
            Java needs to have a type. This is its type. <br>
            - When the abstract method of a functional interface is called, it is the body of the lambda expression that
            is executed. <br>
            - A lambda expression is evaluated to an instance of a functional interface. The body
            of the lambda expression is not executed when the expression is evaluated. <i>The body of the lambda
            expression is
            executed when the method of the functional interface is invoked.</i> <br>
            - Consider the following lambda expression: <code>(String str) -> str.length</code>. What should be the type
            of this Lambda Expression? We cannot say for sure, because it's type can be <i>any </i> interface that takes
            a String as an input and returns an int. The following interface can be the type of this lambda expression:
            <br>
            <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> <br>
            <code>interface StringToIntMapper{</code> <br>
            <code> int strToInt(String s);</code> <br>
            <code>}</code> <br>
            In the above example, whenever the <code>strToInt</code> method of the interface will be called, the lambda
            expression above will be executed.
            <br>
            - The following code snippet shows an example of everything put together:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/4fdf743259dd45ca13ce4b4649b2814f.js"></script>
            </div>
            - Java is a strongly-typed language, which means that the compiler must know the type of all expressions
            used
            in a Java program. a lambda expression by itself does not have a type, and therefore, it cannot be used as a
            standalone
            expression. The type of a lambda expression is always inferred by the compiler by the context in which it is
            used. <br>

            - To jog your memory: <br>
            <li><b>What is functional programming</b>: block of code that accepts values, known as parameters, and the
                block of
                code is executed to compute a result. Order of execution of functions does not matter in Functional
                programming since, unlike object-oriented programming, there is no state of the object that is being
                changed. <a href="https://openhome.cc/eGossip/Blog/index.html">Link to some explanation about FP</a>

            </li>
            <li><b>What is a closure</b>: higher order function (anonymous function that can be treated as a data
                object,
                meaning - it can be stored in a variable and passed around from one context to another.) packaged with
                its defining environment. A closure carries with it the variables in scope when it was defined, and it
                can access those variables even when it is invoked in a context other than the context in which those
                variables were defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What does it mean to <i>capture a variable</i></b>: <a

                or local variables (final or effectively final) from it's enclosing scope.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What is the difference between an <i>implicit</i> and an <i>explicit</i> lambda expression</b>:
                Lambda expression that does not declare the types of its parameters is known as an implicit lambda
                expression. A lambda expression that declares the types of its parameters is known as an explicit lambda
                expression. <code>(x, y) -> x + y</code> is an example of an implicit Lambda Expression.
                <code>(int x, int y) -> x + y</code> is explicit.

        <div class="sub-heading">Target Typing</div>
        <div>
            - There are two kinds of expressions in Java: <br>
            <li>
                <b>Standalone Expressions</b>: A standalone expression is an expression whose type can be determined by
                the expression without knowing the context of its use. <code>new String("Hello")</code>,
                <code>"Hello"</code>, <code>new ArrayList&ltString&gt()</code>. The types are String, String, and
                ArrayList&ltString&gt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Poly Expressions</b>: A poly expression is an expression that has different types in different
                contexts. All lambda expressions in Java are poly expressions. You must use it in a context to know its
                type. For example, the expression <code>new ArrayList&lt&gt()</code> is a poly expression. <br>
                In this:
                <code>ArrayList&ltLong&gt idList = new ArrayList&lt&gt();</code>, its type is
                <code>ArrayList&ltLong&gt</code>. <br>
                Whereas in <code>ArrayList&ltString&gt nameList = new ArrayList&lt&gt();</code>, its type is <code>ArrayList&ltString&gt</code>
            </li>
            - The compiler infers the type of a lambda expression. The context in which a lambda expression is used
            expects a type, which is called the
            <i>target type</i>. The process of inferring the type of a lambda expression from the context is known as
            <i>target typing</i>.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b810f6efcb074aa197646bacf8ce00ea.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Behavior Parameterization</div>
        <div>
            - Changing the behavior of a method through its parameters is known as behavior parameterization. This is
            also known as passing code as data because you pass code (logic, functionality, or behavior) encapsulated in
            lambda expressions to methods as if it is data. <br>
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/acc99d55de825af933ecba4c61ae3140.js"></script>
            </div>
            - In the above example, instead of passing the lambda expression directly as a parameter, you could have
            assigned it to a variable of the desired type (<code>AnotherJoiner</code> in this case) and passed that

        <div class="sub-heading">Which contexts can a Lambda Expression be used</div>
        <div>
            - Lambda expressions can be used only in the following contexts:
            <li>
                <i>Assignment Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear to the right-hand side of the assignment
                operator in an assignment statement.
                For example: <code>ReferenceType variable1 = LambdaExpression;</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Method Invocation Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear as an argument to a method or
                constructor call.
                For example: <code>behavParam.testJoiner(LambdaExpression);</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Return Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear in a return statement inside a method, as its
                target type is the declared return type of the method.
                For example: <code>return LambdaExpression;</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Cast Context</i>: A lambda expression may be used if it is preceded by a cast. The type specified in
                the cast is its target type. <br>
                For example: <code>(Joiner) LambdaExpression;</code>
            </li>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Functional Interfaces</div>
        <div>
            - A functional interface is simply an interface that has exactly one abstract method. <br>
            - The following types of methods in an interface do not count for defining a functional interface: <br>
            <li>
                Default Methods: Recall
                <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html">default methods</a>
                were methods added to an interface that were not abstract. That is, a default
                method has an implementation right there in the interface itself.
            </li>
            <li>Static Methods (remember that a method defined as <code>static</code> in an interface also needs to be
                implemented right there in the interface itself.)
            </li>

        <div class="sub-heading">Method References</div>
        <div>
            - A method reference is shorthand to create a lambda expression using an existing method. <br>
            - Using method references makes your lambda expressions more readable and concise; <i>it also lets you use
            the existing methods</i>.
            <br>
            - If a lambda expression contains a body that is an expression using a method call, you can use a method
            reference in place of that lambda expression. <br>
            - The general syntax for a method reference is: <code>&ltQualifier&gt::&ltMethodName&gt</code>. The
            <code>Qualifier</code> depends on the type of the method reference. The <code>MethodName</code> is the name
            of the method. <br>
            - The syntax for method references allows specifying only the method name. You cannot specify the parameter
            types and return type of the method. Recall that a method reference is shorthand for a lambda expression.
            The target type, which is always a functional interface, determines the method's details. If the method is
            an overloaded method, the compiler will choose the most specific method based on the context. <br>
            - A method reference does not call the method when it is declared. The method is called later when the
            method
            of its target type is called.

            an abstract class.
            <br>
            - The keyword <code>new</code> refers to the constructor of the class. <br>
            - A class may have multiple constructors. The syntax does not provide a way to refer to a specific
            constructor. The compiler selects a specific constructor based on the context. It looks at the target type
            and the number of arguments in the abstract method of the target type. The constructor whose number of
            arguments matches with the number of arguments in the abstract method of the target type is chosen. <br>

            - Arrays in Java do not have constructors. There is a special syntax to use constructor references for

        <div class="sub-heading">Lexical Scoping</div>
        <div>
            - A scope is the part of a Java program within which a name can be referred to without using a qualifier.
            Classes and
            methods define their own scope. Scopes may be nested. <br>
            - Even though a lambda expression looks like a method declaration, it does not define a scope of its own. It
            exists in its enclosing scope. This is known as <i>lexical scoping</i> for lambda expressions. For example,
            when a lambda
            expression is used inside a method, the lambda expression exists in the scope of the method. <br>
            - The meanings of the keywords <code>this</code> and <code>super</code> are the same inside the lambda
            expression and its enclosing
            method. Note that this is different from the meanings of these keywords inside a local and anonymous inner
            class in
            which the keyword <code>this</code> refers to the current instance of the local and anonymous inner class,
            not its enclosing class. <br>
            - Lexical scoping of a lambda expression means that variables declared in the lambda expression, including
            its
            parameters, exist in the enclosing scope. Simple names in a scope must be unique. It means that a lambda
            expression
            cannot redefine variables with the same name that already exist in the enclosing scope.

                Link explaining why variables inside a lambda have to be final or effectively final.</a> <br>
            - A lambda expression can access instance and class variables of a class whether they are effectively final
            or not.
            If instance and class variables are not final, they can be modified inside the body of the lambda
            expressions. a lambda
            expression keeps a copy of the local variables used in its body. If the local variables are reference
            variables, a copy of the
            references is kept, not a copy of the objects.

            - The semantics of <code>this</code> is actually one of the areas where Java lambdas differ from anonymous
            implementations of interfaces. An anonymous interface implementation can have its own instance variables
            which are referenced via the <code>this</code> reference. However, an lambda cannot have its own instance
            variables, so <code>this</code> always points to the enclosing object.

        <div class="sub-heading">What is a Stream</div>
        <div>
            - A stream is a sequence of data elements supporting sequential and parallel <i>aggregate</i> operations.
            <br>
            - So what is an <i>aggregate operation: </i> An aggregate operation computes a single value from a
            collection of values. The result of an aggregate operation may be simply a primitive value, an object, or a
            void. Note that an object may represent a single entity such as a person or a collection of values such as a
            list, a set, a map, etc. <br>
            - Computing the sum of all elements in a stream of integers, mapping all names in list to their lengths,
            etc. are examples of aggregate operations on streams. <br>
            - So what is the difference between a Stream and a Collection: Both are abstractions for a collection of
            data elements. Collections focus on storage of data elements for efficient access whereas streams focus on
            aggregate computations on data elements from a data source that is typically, but not necessarily,
            collections. <br>
            - Following are the points of comparison between Streams and Collections.

            <li><b>Streams have no storage</b>: A collection is an in-memory data structure that stores all its
                elements. All elements must exist in memory before they are added to the collection. A stream has no
                storage; it does not store elements. A stream pulls elements from a data source on-demand and passes
                them to a pipeline of operations for processing.
            </li>

            <li><b>Infinite Streams</b>: A collection stores all its elements in memory, and therefore, it is not
                possible to have an infinite number of elements in a collection. A stream pulls its elements from a data
                source that can be a collection, a function that generates data, an I/O channel, etc. Because a function
                can generate an infinite number of elements and a stream can pull data from it on demand, it is possible
                to have a stream representing a sequence of infinite data elements.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Internal Iteration vs. External Iteration</b>: YOu are normally accustomed to writing for-each loops
                for iterating over a collection. This code has to be written by you - the client. In contrast, streams
                will internally iterate over the collection. This will become clear once you see the example. But,
                streams also provide an
                <code>iterator()</code> method that returns an Iterator to be used for external iteration of its
                elements. You will "never" need to iterate elements of a stream yourself using its iterator.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Imperative vs Functional</b>: The Streams API supports functional programming. Operations on a stream
                produce a result without modifying the data source.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Stream Operations</b>: A Stream supports two types of data operations - Intermediate, Terminal.
                Intermediate operations are known as <i>lazy</i> operations whereas terminal operations are known as <i>eager</i>
                operations. Operations are known as lazy and eager based on the way they pull the data elements from the
                data source. A lazy operation on a stream does not process the elements of the stream until another
                eager operation is called on the stream. <br>
                - Streams connect though a chain of operations forming a stream pipeline. A stream is inherently lazy
                until you call a terminal operation on it. An intermediate operation on a stream produces another
                stream. When you call a terminal operation on a stream, the elements are pulled from the data source and
                pass through the stream pipeline. Each intermediate operation takes elements from an input stream and
                transforms the elements to produce an output stream. The terminal operation takes inputs from a stream
                and produces the result.

                <div class="row">
                    <img src="imgs/Streams/StreamPipeline.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="StreamPipeline"
                         width="50%">
                </div>

                - The above figure shows a stream pipeline with a data source, three streams, and three operations. The
                filter and map operations are intermediate operations and the reduce operation is a terminal operation.
                <br>
                - In the figure, the first stream (on the left) pulls data from the data source and becomes the input
                source for the filter operation. The filter operation produces another stream containing data for which
                the filter condition is true. The stream produced by the filter operation becomes the input for the map
                operation. The map operation produces another stream that contains the mapped data. The stream produced
                by the map operation becomes the input for the reduce operation. The reduce operation is a terminal
                operation. It computes and returns the result, and then the processing of stream is over. <br>
                - Stream processing does not start until a terminal operation is called. If you just call intermediate
                operations on a stream, nothing exciting happens, except that they create another stream objects in
                memory, without reading data from the data source. This implies that you must use a terminal operation
                on a stream for it to process the data to produce a result.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Ordered Streams</b>: A data source is said to have an <i>encounter order</i> if the order in which
                the elements are traversed by an iterator is predictable and meaningful. For example, arrays and lists
                always have an encounter order that is from the element at index 0 to the element at the last index.
                Streams based on data sources having an encounter order also have an encounter order for their elements.
                <br>
                - Sometimes a stream operation may impose an encounter order on an otherwise unordered stream. For
                example, a HashSet does not have an encounter order for its elements. However, applying a sort operation
                on a stream based on a HashSet imposes an encounter order so that elements are yielded in sorted order.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Streams Are Not Reusable</b>: Unlike collections, streams are not reusable. If you need to perform a
                computation on the same elements from the same data source again, you must recreate the stream pipeline.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Architecture of the Streams API:</b>
                - All stream interfaces inherit from the <code>BaseStream</code> interface, which inherits from the
                <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface from the java.lang package. In practice, most streams use
                collections as their data source, and collections do not need to be closed. When a stream is based on a
                closeable data source such as a file I/O channel, you may create the instance of the stream using a
                try-with-resources statement to get it closed automatically. <br>
                - The <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface represents a stream of the element type <code>T</code>; for
                example, a Stream&ltPerson&gt represents a stream of Person objects. <br>
                - Note that the <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface takes a type parameter <code>T</code>, which means
                that you can use it only to work with
                the elements of the reference type. If you have to work with a stream of primitive type such as int,
                long, etc. you should use specialized stream interfaces called
                <code>IntStream</code>, <code>LongStream</code>, and <code>DoubleStream</code> to work with primitives
                <div class="row">

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Creating Streams</div>
        <div>
            <li>
                <b>Streams from Values</b>: The Stream interface contains the following two static <code>of()</code>
                methods to create a sequential Stream from a single value
                and multiple values: <br>
                <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt of(T t)</code> <br>
                <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt of(T... values)</code> <br>
                - The <code>Stream.of()</code> method creates a stream whose elements are of reference type. If you want
                to create a stream of primitive values from an array of primitive type, you need to use the
                <code>Arrays.stream()</code> method. <br>


                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/155a29eca3f80fe7741fa67d5d428206.js"></script>
                </div>

                - The Stream interface also supports creating a stream using the builder pattern using the
                <code>Stream.Builder&ltT&gt</code> interface whose instance represents a stream builder. The <code>builder()</code>
                static method of the Stream interface returns a stream builder. <br>
                - This is how you get a Stream Builder:
                <code>Stream.Builder&ltString&gt builder = Stream.builder();</code>
                <br>
                - You can then add elements to the stream by using either <code>add</code> or <code>accept</code>
                methods. Why do you need two methods to add elements to a Stream, you ask? Well because,
                <code>Stream.Builder&ltT&gt</code> interface inherits from the <code>Consumer&ltT&gt</code> interface,
                (meaning, <code>interface Builder&ltT&gt extends Consumer&ltT&gt</code>)
                and therefore it inherits the <code>accept</code> method from the <code>Consumer&ltT&gt</code>
                interface. <br>
                - The <code>add()</code> method returns the reference to the builder that makes it suitable for adding
                multiple elements using method chaining. Once you are done adding elements, call the
                <code>build()</code> method to create the stream. You cannot add elements to the stream after you call
                the <code>build()</code> method; doing so results in an <code>IllegalStateException</code> runtime
                exception.

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Empty Streams</b>: An empty stream is a stream with no elements. The Stream interface contains an
                <code>empty()</code> static method to create an empty sequential stream.

                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/405c30e562e22b66df28451010daf3b9.js"></script>
                </div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Streams from Functions</b>: The Stream interface contains the following two <code>static</code>
                methods to generate an infinite stream:
                <br>
                - <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt iterate(T seed, UnaryOperator&ltT&gt f)</code> <br>
                - <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt generate(Supplier&ltT&gt s)</code> <br>
                <br>
                a) Using the <code>Stream.iterate()</code> Method: <br>
                - The <code>iterate()</code> method takes two arguments: a seed and a function. The first argument is a
                seed that is the first element of the stream. The second element is generated by applying the function
                to the first element. The third element is generated by applying the function on the second element and
                so on. <br>
                - Its elements are - seed, f(seed), f(f(seed)), f(f(f(seed))), and so on. <br>

                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/1ace319f763e2b8e76c1beae18946284.js"></script>
                </div>

                b) Using the <code>Stream.generate()</code> Method: <br>
                - The <code>generate(Supplier &ltT&gt s)</code> method uses the specified <code>Supplier</code> to
                generate an
                infinite sequential unordered stream. <br>
                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/42fd0acbd852cb7e1eb16af85c980b9e.js"></script>
                </div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Streams from Arrays</b>: The <code>Arrays</code> class in the java.util package contains an
                overloaded <code>stream()</code> <code>static</code> method to create sequential streams from arrays.
                You can use it to create an <code>IntStream</code> from an <code>int</code> array, a
                <code>LongStream</code> from a <code>long</code> array, a <code>DoubleStream</code> from a
                <code>double</code> array, and a <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> from an array of the reference type
                <code>T</code>. <br>
                - Recall when we saw in the <code>Stream.of(T... t)</code> method in the first point, we could also pass
                in an array over there as well. So you can create a stream from a reference type array using two
                methods: <code>Arrays.stream(T[] t)</code> and <code>Stream.of(T...t)</code> method.

                <b>Streams from Collections</b>: The Collection interface contains the <code>stream()</code> and <code>parallelStream()</code>
                methods that create sequential and parallel streams from a Collection, respectively.

        <div class="sub-heading">Representing an Optional Value</div>
        <div>
            - An <code>Optional</code> is a wrapper for a non-null value that may or may not contain a non-null value.
            Its <code>isPresent()</code> method returns true if it contains a non-null value, false otherwise. Its
            <code>get()</code> method returns the non-null value if it contains a non-null value, and throws a
            <code>NoSuchElementException</code> otherwise. This implies that when a method returns an
            <code>Optional</code>, you must, as a practice, check if it contains a non-null value before asking it for
            the value. If you use the <code>get()</code> method before making sure it contains a non-null value, you may
            get
            a <code>NoSuchElementException</code> instead of getting a <code>NullPointerException</code>. <br>
            - There are 4 methods to get the value from an optional: <br>
            <li><code>T get()</code></li>
            <li><code>T orElse(T defaultValue)</code></li>
            <li><code>T orElseGet(Supplier&lt? extends T&gt defaultSupplier)</code></li>
            <li><code>&ltX extends Throwable&gt T orElseThrow(Supplier&lt? extends X&gt exceptionSupplier)</code>

        <div class="sub-heading">Debugging a Stream Pipeline</div>
        <div>
            - Sometimes you may need to look at the elements of the streams as they pass through the pipeline. You can
            do so by using the
            <code>peek(Consumer&lt? super T&gt action)</code> method of the <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface that is
            meant only
            for debugging purposes. It produces a stream after applying an action on each input element.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/455001ae7c38c7f30f0aff3e4b16a748.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Applying the ForEach Operation</div>
        <div>
            - The <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface has two methods to perform the forEach operation: <br>
            <code>void forEach(Consumer&lt? super T&gt action)</code> <br>
            <code>void forEachOrdered(Consumer&lt? super T&gt action)</code> <br>
            - Why the need for 2 methods: <br>
            Sometimes the order in which the action is
            applied for the elements in a stream is important, and sometimes it is not. The <code>forEach()</code>
            method does not guarantee
            the order in which the action for each element in the stream is applied. The <code>forEachOrdered()</code>
            method performs the
            action in the encounter order of elements defined by the stream. Use the <code>forEachOrdered()</code>
            method for a parallel
            stream only when necessary because it may slow down processing.

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Applying the Map Operation</div>
        <div>
            - A map operation (also known as mapping) applies a function to each element of the input stream to produce
            another stream (also called an output stream or a mapped stream). The number of elements in the input and
            output streams is the same. The operation does not modify the elements of the input stream (at least it is
            not supposed to). <br>

            <div class="row">
                <img src="imgs/Streams/map_operation.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="map_operation"
                     width="40%">
            </div>

            - You can apply the map operation on a stream using one of the following methods of the Stream&ltT&gt
            interface:
            <li><code>&ltR&gt Stream&ltR&gt map(Function&lt? super T,? extends R&gt mapper)</code></li>
            <li><code>DoubleStream mapToDouble(ToDoubleFunction&lt? super T&gt mapper)</code></li>
            <li><code>IntStream mapToInt(ToIntFunction&lt? super T&gt mapper)</code></li>
            <li><code>LongStream mapToLong(ToLongFunction&lt? super T&gt mapper)</code></li>

            - We have already looked at examples of <code>map</code> in the previous examples.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Flattening Streams</div>
        <div>
            -So far we have seen a one-to-one mapping using the <code>map</code> operation where each element of the
            input stream was mapped to one element of the output stream. But in addition to this, the Stream API also
            supports one-to-many mapping. <br>
            - This is basically to create a stream <i>of streams</i>. Think about how you can create a HashMap of
            HashMaps. Similarly, we are creating a Stream, where each "element" is a Stream. <br>
            - Suppose the input stream is a <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> and the
            mapped stream is <code>Stream&ltStream&ltR&gt&gt</code> where <code>T</code> and <code>R</code> may be the
            same or
            different. <br>
            - Then it "flattens" the output stream, which is currently a Stream of Streams, to produce a single Stream.
            So basically it converts a <code>Stream&ltStream&ltR&gt&gt</code> to <code>Stream&ltR&gt</code> <br>

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/4db5e7779731b92cb1c47eab0b3567c7.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Does this make sense now?
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Applying the Reduce Operation</div>
        <div>
            - The reduce operation combines all elements of a stream to produce a single value by applying a combining
            function
            repeatedly. Computing the sum, maximum, average, count, etc. of elements of a stream of integers are
            examples of the reduce operation. Collecting elements of a stream in a List, Set, or Map is also an example
            of the reduce operation. <br>
            - The reduce operation takes two parameters called a <i>seed</i> (also called an <i>initial value</i>) and
            an <i>accumulator</i>. The accumulator is a function.

            <div class="row">
                <img src="imgs/Streams/reduce_operation.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="reduce_operation"
                     width="50%">
            </div>

            - The <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface contains a <code>reduce()</code> method to perform the reduce
            operation. The method has three overloaded versions:
            <li><code>T reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator&ltT&gt accumulator)</code></li>
            <li>
                <code>&ltU&gt U reduce</code>
                <code>(U identity, BiFunction&ltU,? super T,U&gt accumulator, BinaryOperator&ltU&gt combiner)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>Optional&ltT&gt reduce(BinaryOperator&ltT&gt accumulator)</code>
            </li>

            - JVM: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the virtual machine that runs the Java bytecodes. The JVM doesn't
            understand Java source code; that's why you need to compile your <code>*.java</code> files to obtain
            <code>*.class</code> files that contain the bytecodes understood by the JVM. This compilation is done by
            using the <code>javac</code> command. After compilation, as many <code>.class</code> files will be generated
            as the number of classes in java program (eh.. not really) <br>
            - This is the wrong understanding: Note that inner classes do not get .class files of their own.
            Instead they are present in the .class files of their parent classes itself. [This was because when you look at the file in IntelliJ it shows that, both, the outer
            class and the inner class are in the same file. But, if you go into file explorer in your system and see, you will see that the outer and the inner classes are actually
            in separate files.] <br>
            - The outer class, in this case, is <i>ShadowTest2</i>. This is present in the class file called <i>ShadowTest2.class</i>. The inner class is called <i>FirstLevel2</i>.
            And this is present in the class called <i>ShadowTest2$FirstLevel2.class</i>. This is the format, the parent class name, then the '$' symbol followed by the inner class
            name.

            - On the other hand, classes that are defined as below get their own .class files.
            <div class="code-snippet">

            - The generated .class files are also the entity that
            allows Java to be a "portable language" (write once, run anywhere). Indeed, there are specific
            implementations of the JVM for different systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, see the Wikipedia list), the aim is
            that with the same bytecodes they all give the same results. <br>
            - JRE: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, and other
            components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language. (The point is that, you
            need only the JRE if your sole goal is to only run a Java program.)
            In addition, two key
            deployment technologies are part of the JRE: Java Plug-in, which enables applets to run in popular browsers;
            and Java Web Start, which deploys standalone applications over a network. It is also the foundation for the
            technologies in the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) for enterprise software development and
            deployment. The JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debuggers for developing
            applets and applications. <br>
            - JDK: The JDK is a superset of the JRE, and contains everything that is in the JRE, plus tools such as the
            compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications. <br>

            - It is not necessary that the name of the file should always match the name of the class that is defined
            inside it. If a class is not explicitly defined as <code>public</code>, then the name of the class and the
            name of file within which the class is defined may differ. <a

            - Consider the following scenarios: <br>
            a) File name is same as class name. Class is defined <code>public</code>. Everything works as expected.

                     width="1000">
            </div>

            b) File name is same as class name. Class is not defined <code>public</code>. Hence the default access is
            applied. Default access in java is <code>package-private</code>. Everything still works as expected.

                 width="1000">

            c) File name is different from the class name. Class is not defined <code>public</code>. Note that in this
            case, the <code>class</code> file that is generated has the name as <i>HelloWorldNew</i>. So we run
            <code>java HelloWorldNew</code> in order to run the code in the jvm.

            d) File name is different from the class name. Class is defined <code>public</code>. Note that now the code
            does not even compile. This means that, in order to have the class name different from the file name work,
            you cannot define the class to be <code>public</code>.

            <br>
            - Method Overloading can be implemented in two different ways: <br>
            a) implementing two or more methods that have the <i>same name but different number of arguments</i> <br>
            b) implementing two or more methods that have the <i>same name but take arguments of different types</i>
            <br>
            However, do note that it's not possible to have two method implementations that differ only in their return
            types. In this case, the code simply wouldn't compile because of the method call ambiguity - the compiler
            wouldn't know which implementation of multiply() to call.

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 153: Static Members</div>
        <div>
            - You can declare the following types of <code>static</code> entities in your code: <br>
            a) Static Variables <br>
            b) Static Methods <br>
            c) Static Nested Class <br>
            d) Static Blocks <br>
            - Remember that from a <code>static</code> method, you can only access other <code>static</code> members. You cannot access instance variables from a method that has
            been declared <code>static</code>. You also cannot use the keywords <code>this</code> and <code>super</code> inside a <code>static</code> method because these keywords
            refer to an instance of the class. Only inner classes can be declared as <code>static class <i>className</i> { }</code>. You can overload static methods but you cannot
            override static methods. <br>
            - <code>static</code> members of a class are created inside something known as method area. JVM memory management was changed in JDK8. No idea what this refers to now.
            Supposedly, this method area is created when the class is first loaded. That is why we can access <code>static</code> members directly from the class without having to
            create an object of the class. <br>
            - If you have a bunch of static methods, then you can group them all together in a <code>static</code> block. <br>
            - <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-static#3-key-points-to-remember-1">Source</a> Key points to remember when using a <code>static</code> variable: <br>
            - static methods in Java are resolved at compile time. Since method overriding is part of Runtime Polymorphism, so static methods can't be overridden <br>
            - abstract methods can't be static <br>
            - static methods cannot use this or super keywords <br>
            - The following combinations of the instance, class methods and variables are valid: <br>
            a) Instance methods can directly access both instance methods and instance variables <br>
            b) Instance methods can also access static variables and static methods directly <br>
            c) static methods can access all static variables and other static methods <br>
            d) static methods cannot access instance variables and instance methods directly; they need some object reference to do so <br>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 155: Static Blocks</div>
        <div>
            - We can write down a set of statements in a block and declare the block as <code>static</code>. This <code>static</code> block will be executed when the class is
            loaded, i.e. before the creation of any object of the class. <br>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 157: <code>final</code> Members</div>
        <div>
            - The <code>final</code> keyword can be used in various ways: <br>
            a) final variables <br>
            b) final methods <br>
            c) final class <br>
            - There are 3 methods of initialising <code>final</code> variables: <br>
            a) Initialize them when you have declared them <br>
            b) Initialize within a <code>static</code> block <br>
            c) Initialize them inside the constructor of the class. If the class has multiple constructors, then the variable must be initialized withing all of the constructors
            <br>
            - If a method is declared as <code>final</code> then that method cannot be overridden. Similarly, if a class is declared as <code>final</code>, the class cannot be
            extended.

            returns an error. No error is produced if we comment out the package name and then compile and re-run the program. <br>

            The self answer by Stephen that explains how you launch a program from the CLI using the java command.

            - So how do we make sure that the .class file is placed within the right package? For that we have to compile the program with a different command. <br>
            - We use <code>java -d . Demo.java</code> to compile the program. The -d args stands for <i>directory</i>. The <code> . </code> means that the root of the folder of the
            generated class files should be the current folder. <br>
            - The -d args sets the destination directory (or class output directory)
            for class files. If a class is part of a package, then javac puts the class file in a subdirectory that reflects the module name (if appropriate) and package name. The
            directory, and any necessary subdirectories, will be created if they do not already exist.
            If the -d option is not specified, then javac puts each class file in the same directory as the source file from which it was generated.

            - Two things need to be written down: one was how we compile a program from the command line so that the individual .class files actually end up in packages. <br>

            - Second was understanding the difference between the different types of access that are present in java: public, protected, default, private.

        <div>
            - There are four levels of access modifiers: public, default, protected, private <br>
            - A class can have three types of members: variables, methods, inner class. An access modifier can be used on any of these types of members. The exception to this rule
            is the outermost class. The outer class can only be either <code>public</code> or <code>default</code>. <br>
            - A class can be used in two ways: either by creating an object of the class, or by extending the class. Both these methods give us a different kind of relationship
            between the two classes.

                 alt="Example1">
            - <code>default</code> members cannot be accessed outside the package. <code>protected</code> members can be accessed outside the package only if the class that is
            accessing the protected member is a subclass of the class in which the member is defined. <br>

            - A <code>try</code> block can have multiple <code>catch</code> blocks. Make sure that there are no super classes of the same exception present in the multiple
            <code>catch</code> blocks. <br>
            - A <code>try-catch</code> block can also have a <code>finally</code> block. The code in the finally block is executed irrespective of whether
            there was an exception during the execution of the program. Even if the program executed properly, the <code>finally</code> block would still be executed. <br>
            - It is not necessary that a <code>try</code> should have a <code>catch</code>. A <code>try</code> can just have a <code>finally</code> and that is still fine. The code
            would still compile.
