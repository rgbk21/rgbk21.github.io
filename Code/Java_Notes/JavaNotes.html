			- You can only specify one super class for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance of
			multiple superclasses into a single subclass. What you can do is create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a subclass becomes a superclass of
			another subclass.

			<div class="sub-heading">Member Access and Inheritance</div>
			- Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of its superclass
			that have been declared as <b>private</b>. A member declared as <b>private</b> is ONLY accessible by other members
			of its own class. These members are not accessible by any code outside of its class, not even by its subclasses.

			<div class="sub-heading">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</div>
			<div>
				A reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is important
				to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that it refers to - that determines what
				members can be accessed.</i> That is when a reference to a subclass object is assigned to a superclass reference variable, you will
				have access to only those parts of the object defined by the superclass.
			</div>
			<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8d3f3665ec70aced023563b5888d2f20.js"></script></div>
			<div class="sub-heading">Understanding super</div>
			<div>
				<b>super</b> has two general forms. The first calls the superclass' constructor. The second is used to access a member of
				the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">a) Using super to call superclass constructors</div>
			<div>
				A subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass by usat it is the type of ing the following form of <b>super</b>:
				super(<i>arg-list</i>)
				<br>
				Here <i>arg-list</i> specifies any arguments needed by the constructor in the superclass. <b>super()</b> must also always be the
				first statement that is executed inside a subclass' constructor.
				<br>
				- Since constructors can be overloaded, <b>super()</b> can be called using abd form defined by the superclass.
				The constructor executed will be the one that matches the arguments.
				<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7239243bccc65ce54f32df1b7248e120.js"></script></div>
				Notice that <b>super()</b> is passed an object of type <b>BoxWeight</b> - not of type <b>Box</b>. This still
				invokes the constructor <b>Box(Box obj)</b>. As mentioned earlier, a superclass variable can be used to reference any object
				derived from that class. Thus we are able to pass a <b>BoxWeight</b> object to the <b>Box</b> constructor.
				<br>
				- So this is the key concept behind <b>super()</b>: when a subclass calls <b>super()</b>, it is calling the constructor
				of its immediate superclass. Thus <b>super()</b> always refers to the superclass immediately above the calling class.
				Also, <b>super()</b> must always be the first statement executed inside a subclass constructor (that is
				IF you are using a <b>super()</b>).
				<br>
				- Remember that if you are calling the constructor of the subclass, and that constructor does not contain a <b>super()</b>,
				the default no-args constructor of the superclass will be called. If the superclass does not have the default constructor,
				the code will not compile (recall that default constructor is present in every class, but if you are creating a constructor of your
				 own then you will also have to create a default constructor).
				<br>
				<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34488484/why-is-super-class-constructor-always-called?lq=1">Why is the superclass constructor always called</a>
				<br>
				- The constructors of the parent classes are called, all the way up the class hierarchy through <b>Object</b>, before the child class's
				constructor is called.
				<br>
				-With <b>super()</b>, the superclass no-argument constructor is called. With <b>super(parameter list)</b>, the superclass
				constructor with a matching parameter list is called. Note: If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a
				superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the
				superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error.
				<b>Object</b> does have such a constructor, so if <b>Object</b> is the only superclass, there is no problem.
				If a subclass constructor invokes a constructor of its superclass, either explicitly or implicitly, you
				might think that there will be a whole chain of constructors called, all the way back to the constructor of <b>Object</b>.
				In fact, this is the case. It is called constructor chaining, and you need to be aware of it when there is
				a long line of class descent.
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">b) A second use of super</div>
			<div>
				The second form of <b>super</b> acts somewhat like <b>this</b>, except that it always refers to the superclass of the subclass
				in which it is used. The usage has the following general form: <b>super.<i>member</i></b>. Here <i>member</i> can be either a
				method or instance variable. This second form of <b>super</b> is most applicable to situations in which member names of a
				subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass.
				<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b8a1eff34f8ebf8331a78eeaeca6ebe5.js"></script></div>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">Creating a MultiLevel Hierarchy</div>
			<div>
				You can build hierarchies that contain as many layers of inheritance as you like. Because of inheritance, Shipment can make use of the
				previously defined classes of BoxWeight and Box, adding only the extra information that it needs for its own, specific application.
				<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1fb9bc209d80caa7011327b0bf7f17b.js"></script></div>
				This example illustrates an important point - <b>super</b> always refers to the constructor in the closest superclass. The
				<b>super()</b> in Shipment calls the constructor in BoxWeight. The <b>super()</b> in BoxWeight calls the constructor in Box.
				<br>
				- In a class hierarchy, if a superclass constructor requires arguments, then all subclasses must pass those arguments "up the line".
				This is true whether or not a subclass needs an argument of its own.
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">When Constructors are Executed</div>
			<div>
				In a class heirarchy, constructors complete their execution in the order of derivation, from superclass to subclass. Furthe,
				since <b>super()</b> must be the first statement that is executed in a subclass' contructor, this order is the same whether or not
				<b>super()</b> is used. If <b>super()</b> is not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of each superclass will be
				executed.
				<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/93a913ea7c83ad866875433b6f3b09da.js"></script></div>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">Method Overriding</div>
			<div>
				In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass, then the method in the
				subclass is said to <i>override</i> the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is called from within its subclass,
				it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass. The version of the method defined by the superclass
				will be hidden.
				<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0db84861d6a4b08c62815ce370f217df.js"></script></div>
				Remember that method overriding occurs ONLY when the names AND the type signatures are identical. Otherwise the two methods
				are simply overloaded.
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">Dynamic Method Dispatch</div>
			<div>
				Method Overloading provides the basis for Java's: <i>Dynamic Method Dispatch</i>. Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which
				a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than compile time. Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how
				Java implements run-time polymorphism. The basis for Dynamic Method Dispatch just that: a superclass reference variable can refer to a
				subclass object. Java uses this fact to resolve calls to overridden methods. This is how it is done: when an overridden method
				is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method  to execute based upon the type
				of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is amde at runtime. When different types
				of objects are referred to, different versions of an overridden method will be called.
				<br>
				- In other words: <i>it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable)
				that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.</i> Therefore, if a superclass contains
				a method that is overridden by a subclass, then when different types of objects are referred to through a superclass
				reference variable, different versions of the method are executed. Compare this with what we read in
				"A superclass variable can reference a subclass object" section.
				<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1e79c337d71a4468731f182f443b4cb.js"></script></div>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">Using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods</div>
			<div>
				You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the <b>abstract</b> type modifier.These
				methods are sometimes referred to as <i>subclasser responsibility</i> because these methods have no implementation
				specified in the superclass. Hence, a subclass MUST override them - it cannot simply use the version defined in the superclass.
				To declare an abstract method, use this general form:
				<b>abstract <i>type name (parameter-list);</i> </b>
				<br>
				Note the closing semi-colon. No method body is present. Abstract methods CANNOT have a body. Abstract classes can have
				concrete methods along with abstract methods though.
				<br>
				- Any class that contains one or more abstract methods MUST also be declared abstract. There can be no objects of an
				abstract class. That is, an abstract class cannot be instantiated using a <b>new</b> operator. Also, you cannot
				declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods. Any subclass of an abstract method must either implement
				all of the abstract methods or be declared <b>abstract</b> itself.
				<br>
				- Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object references.
				<br>
				- To declare a class abstract:
				<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8974236d5a5b60ecb8407a47f497e8e6.js"></script></div>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">Using final with Inheritance</div>
			<div>
				The keyword <b>final</b> has 3 uses - the first is in creating a named constant. The other 2 uses of <b>final</b> apply to
				inheritance.
				<div class="sub-heading">a) Using final to prevent Overriding</div>
				<div>
					- To disallow a method from being overridden, specify <b>final</b> as a modifier at the start of its declaration.
					Methods declared as <b>final</b> cannot be overridden.
					<br>
					- Methods declared as <b>final</b> can sometimes also provide performance enhancement by <i>inlining</i> calls to them.
					Normally, Java resolves calls to methods dynamically aat run-time. This is called <i>late-binding</i>.
					However, since <b>final</b> methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved at compile time. This is
					called <i>early-binding</i>.
					<div class="code-snippet"><script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b3b6eb7183aa934df4e18a184fb58a3c.js"></script></div>
				</div>
				<div class="sub-heading">b) Using final to prevent Inheritance</div>
				<div>
					- Sometimes, you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class declaration
					with <b>final</b>. Declaring a class as <b>final</b> implicitly declares all of ots methods as <b>final</b>
					too.
					<br>
					- As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both <b>abstract</b> and <b>final</b> (since an abstract class
					is incomplete by itself and relies upon its subclasses to provide complete implementations).

			<div class="sub-heading">Local Variable Type Inference and Inheritance</div>
			<div>
				//TODO - keyword <b>var</b>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">The Object Class</div>
			<div>
				There is one special class, <b>Object</b>, defined by Java. All other Classes are subclasses of <b>Object</b>.
				That is, <b>Object</b> is a superclass of all the other classes. This means that a reference variable of type
				<b>Object</b> can refer to an object of any other class.
				<div class="row">
					<img src="ObjectClass.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="Example1">
				</div>
				Notice two methods, <b>equals()</b> and <b>toString()</b>.
				<br>
				- The <b>equals()</b> method compares two objects. it returns <b>true</b> if the objects are equal,
				and <b>false</b> otherwise. The precise definition of equality can differ depending on the types of objects being compared.
				<br>
				- The <b>toString()</b> method returns a string that contains a description of the object on which it is called.
				Also, this method is automatically called when an object is output using <b>println()</b>. Many classes override this method.
				Doing so allows them to tailor a description specifically for the types of objects that they create.
				<br>
				- Notice Generics...? LOL.
