    - There are 4 aspects of Object-Oriented programming (OOP): <br>
    a) Abstraction (fancy way of saying that you can ignore most of the details) <br>
    b) Encapsulation (data-hiding using <code>private</code> members to access state of a class) <br>
    c) Inheritance <br>
    d) Polymorphism (says that - don't worry about the reference you have at hand. Go ahead and call the method and
    we will call the right method based on the true type of the object at runtime, and not the perceived type of the
    object at compile time) <br>
    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8960918/encapsulation-vs-abstraction?">SO Link </a> that explains
    the difference betweenn Abstraction and Encapsulation. <br>

    <br>
    <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-composition-aggregation-association">What is Composition, Aggregation, and Association?</a><br>

    <p class="inline-heading">Composition</p>: Think of it as a "has-a" kind of relationship, compared to inheritance which is more of a "is-a" kind of relationship. For eg. a
    building <i>has a </i> room. Composition is a strong kind of "has-a" relationship because the containing object owns it. Therefore, the objects' lifecycles are tied. It means
    that if we destroy the owner object, its members also will be destroyed with it. So if we destroyed the building, the room would also be destroyed.
    In Java, we can model this with a non-static inner class: <br>
    <code>class Building {</code> <br>
    <code> class Room {}</code> <br>
    <code>}</code>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="inline-heading">Aggregation</p>: Aggregation is also a "has-a" relationship. What distinguishes it from composition, that
    it doesn't involve owning. As a result, the lifecycles of the objects aren't tied: every one of them can exist independently of each other. In Java, we can model aggregation
    with a plain old reference: <br>
    <code>class Wheel {}</code> <br>
    <code>class Car {</code> <br>
    <code> List&lt;Wheel&gt wheels;</code> <br>
    <code>}</code>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="inline-heading">Association:</p> Association is the weakest relationship between the three. It isn't a "has - a"
    relationship, none of the objects are parts or members of another. In Java, we can model association the same way as aggregation: <br>
    <code>class Child {}</code> <br>
    <code>class Mother {</code> <br>
    <code> List&lt;Child&gt children;</code> <br>
    <code>}</code>

    <br>
    <br>

    How can we tell if a reference means aggregation or association?
    Well, we can't. The difference is only logical: whether one of the objects is part of the other or not. <br>
    - And then there is <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/61446">this SO link</a>. <br>

    - <b>L</b>iskov substitution principle: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56860/what-is-an-example-of-the-liskov-substitution-principle">This SO Link</a> explains using examples what this actually means.
    <br>
    - Check <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-method-overload-override#1-type-substitutability">this on Baeldung for a much clearer explanation</a>. It says: <br>
    It's valid to make an overridden method to accept arguments of different types and return a different type as well, but with full adherence to these rules. (But note that not
    all of these rules apply in the case of java. Java rules are present below this) <br>
    a) If a method in the base class takes argument(s) of a given type, the overridden method should take the same type or a <i>supertype</i> (NOTE: It's supertype, NOT subtype)
    (a.k.a. <i>contravariant</i> method arguments). Refer <a href="../ThingsToRemember/ThingsToRemember.html#66.2">66.2</a> and
    <a href="../ThingsToRemember/ThingsToRemember.html#66.3">66.3</a>. <br>
    b) If a method in the base class returns <code>void</code>, the overridden method should return <code>void</code> <br>
    c) If a method in the base class returns a primitive, the overridden method should return the same primitive <br>
    d) If a method in the base class returns a certain type, the overridden method should return the same type or a <i>subtype</i> (NOTE: It's subtype, NOT supertype) (a.k.a. <i>covariant</i>
    return type). Refer <a href="../ThingsToRemember/ThingsToRemember.html#66.1">66.1</a>. <br>
    e) If a method in the base class throws an exception, the overridden method must throw the same exception or a subtype of the base class exception

    - <a href="https://briangordon.github.io/2014/09/covariance-and-contravariance.html">Source</a>. <br>
    - The overriding method is <i>covariant</i> in the return type and <i>invariant</i> in the argument types. That means that the return type of the overriding method can be a
    subclass of the return type of the overridden method, but the argument types must match exactly. <br>
    - If the argument types aren't identical in the subclass then the method will be <i>overloaded</i> instead of <i>overridden</i>. You should always use the
    <code>@Override</code> annotation to ensure that this doesn't happen accidentally. <br>

    <div class="sub-heading">Inheritance Basics</div>
    - A class that does the inheriting is called the <i>subclass</i> and the class that is inherited is called the <i>superclass</i>.
    Therefore, a subclass is a specialized version of the superclass and adds its own unique elements. <br>
    - class <i>subclass-name</i> extends <i>superclass-name</i>{
    <br>
    }

      </div>
    </div>
    - You can only specify one super class for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance
    of multiple superclasses into a single subclass. What you can do is create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a
    subclass becomes a superclass of another subclass.

    <div class="sub-heading">Member Access and Inheritance</div>
    - Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of its
    superclass that have been declared as <code>private</code>. A member declared as <code>private</code> is ONLY
    accessible by other members of its own class. These members are not accessible by any code outside of its class,
    not even by its subclasses.

    <div id="superclass_reference" class="sub-heading">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</div>
    <div>
      A reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is
      important to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that
      it refers to - that determines what members can be accessed.</i> That is when a reference to a subclass
      object is assigned to a superclass reference variable, you will have access to only those parts of the
      object defined by the superclass.

    <div class="sub-heading">Understanding super</div>
    <div>
      <code>super</code> has two general forms. The first calls the superclass' constructor. The second is used to
      access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">a) Using super to call superclass constructors</div>
    <div>
      A subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass by use of the following form of
      <code>super</code>:
      <code>super(<i>arg-list</i>)</code>
      <br>
      Here <i>arg-list</i> specifies any arguments needed by the constructor in the superclass.
      <code>super()</code> must also always be the first statement that is executed inside a subclass'
      constructor.
      <br>
      - Since constructors can be overloaded, <code>super()</code> can be called using any form defined by the
      superclass. The constructor executed will be the one that matches the arguments.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7239243bccc65ce54f32df1b7248e120.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      Notice that <code>super()</code> is passed an object of type <code>BoxWeight</code> - not of type
      <code>Box</code>. This still
      invokes the constructor <code>Box(Box obj)</code>. As mentioned earlier, a superclass variable can be used
      to
      reference any object derived from that class. Thus we are able to pass a <code>BoxWeight</code> object to
      the <code>Box</code> constructor.
      <br>
      - So this is the key concept behind <code>super()</code>: when a subclass calls <code>super()</code>, it is
      calling the constructor of its immediate superclass. Thus <code>super()</code> always refers to the
      superclass immediately above the calling class. Also, <code>super()</code> must always be the first
      statement executed inside a subclass constructor (that is IF you are using a <code>super()</code>).
      <br>
      - Remember that if you are calling the constructor of the subclass, and that constructor does not contain a
      <code>super()</code>, the default no-args constructor of the superclass will be called. If the superclass
      does not have the
      default constructor, the code will not compile (recall that default constructor is present in every class,
      but if you are
      creating a constructor of your own then you will also have to create a default constructor).
      <br>
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34488484/why-is-super-class-constructor-always-called?lq=1">Why
        is the superclass constructor always called</a>
      <br>
      - The constructors of the parent classes are called, all the way up the class hierarchy through
      <code>Object</code>, before the child class's constructor is called.
      <br>
      - With <code>super()</code>, the superclass no-argument constructor is called.
      With <code>super(parameter-list)</code>, the superclass constructor with a matching parameter list is
      called.
      Note: If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a
      superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the
      superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error.
      <code>Object</code> does have such a constructor, so if <code>Object</code> is the only superclass, there is
      no problem.
      If a subclass constructor invokes a constructor of its superclass, either explicitly or implicitly, you
      might think that there will be a whole chain of constructors called, all the way back to the constructor of
      <code>Object</code>. In fact, this is the case. It is called constructor chaining, and you need to be aware
      of it when there is
      a long line of class descent.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">b) A second use of super</div>
    <div>
      The second form of <code>super</code> acts somewhat like <code>this</code>, except that it always refers to
      the
      superclass of the subclass in which it is used. The usage has the following general form: <code>super.<i>member</i></code>.
      Here
      <i>member</i> can be either a method or instance variable. This second form of <code>super</code> is most
      applicable to situations in which
      member names of a subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass.

    <div class="sub-heading">Creating a MultiLevel Hierarchy</div>
    <div>
      You can build hierarchies that contain as many layers of inheritance as you like. Because of inheritance,
      Shipment can make use of the previously defined classes of BoxWeight and Box, adding only the extra
      information that it needs for its own, specific application.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>
      This example illustrates an important point - <code>super</code> always refers to the constructor in the
      closest
      superclass. The <code>super()</code> in Shipment calls the constructor in BoxWeight. The
      <code>super()</code> in BoxWeight calls the constructor in Box.
      <br>
      - In a class hierarchy, if a superclass constructor requires arguments, then all subclasses must pass those
      arguments "up the line". This is true whether or not a subclass needs an argument of its own. <br>
      - This is another example: the question was - given an abstract class Car, with one abstract method
      getMileage, create 2 classes that extend the class.

    <div class="sub-heading">When Constructors are Executed</div>
    <div>
      -In a class hierarchy, constructors complete their execution in the order of derivation, from superclass to
      subclass. Further, since <code>super()</code> must be the first statement that is executed in a subclass'
      constructor, this order is the same whether or not <code>super()</code> is used. If <code>super()</code> is
      not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of each superclass will be executed.

    <div class="sub-heading">Behavior in the case of parameterized constructors</div>
    <div>
      - Note the example below. The <i>Child</i> class is inheriting from the <i>Parent</i> class. <br>
      - We have already seen that in the case of inheritance, the constructor of the parent class is called first. <br>
      - Hence, in the first case, the call to the non-parameterized constructor of the <i>Child</i> class first calls the non-parameterized constructor of the <i>Parent</i>
      class. That is the expected behavior. <br>
      - Note the second case carefully: the call to the parameterized constructor of the <i>Child</i> class calls the non-parameterized constructor of the <i>Parent</i>
      class. This would not change even if you changed the code to include the call to <code>super</code> in the constructor for the <i>Child</i> class. <br>
      - In order to call the parameterized constructor of the child class, you would have to explicitly call the parameterized version of the <code>super</code> method, as
      shown in the third constructor. Ignore the difference of the two args that are being passed, that is only because we cannot create two constructors with the same set of
      args.

    <div class="sub-heading">Method Overriding</div>
    <div>
      In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass, then the
      method in the subclass is said to <i>override</i> the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is
      called from
      within its subclass, it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass. The version
      of the method
      defined by the superclass will be hidden.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>
      Remember that method overriding occurs ONLY when the names AND the type signatures are identical. Otherwise
      the two methods are simply overloaded.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Dynamic Method Dispatch</div>
    <div>
      Method Overriding provides the basis for Java's: <i>Dynamic Method Dispatch</i>. Dynamic method dispatch is
      the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than compile time.
      Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how
      Java implements run-time polymorphism. The basis for Dynamic Method Dispatch just that: a superclass
      reference variable can refer to a
      subclass object. Java uses this fact to resolve calls to overridden methods. This is how it is done: when an
      overridden method
      is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method to execute based upon
      the type
      of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is made at runtime.
      When different types
      of objects are referred to, different versions of an overridden method will be called.
      <br>
      - In other words: <i>it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable)
      that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.</i> Therefore, if a superclass
      contains
      a method that is overridden by a subclass, then when different types of objects are referred to through a
      superclass
      reference variable, different versions of the method are executed. Compare this with what we read in
      <a href="#superclass_reference">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</a>" section: A
      reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is
      important to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that
      it
      refers to - that determines what members can be accessed</i>.

      - Another example that makes more sense is the <code>List</code> interface, and the <code>ArrayList</code>
      and <code>LinkedList</code> classes.
      <br>
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14903145/what-is-the-difference-between-list-and-arraylist">What

      </div>
      - There's no difference between list implementations in both of your examples. There's however a difference
      in a way you can further use variable myList in your code.
      When you define your list as in Line 1, you can only call methods and reference members that are defined in
      the List interface.
      When you define your list as in Line 2, you'll be able to invoke ArrayList-specific methods and use
      ArrayList-specific members
      in addition to those whose definitions are inherited from List.
      <br>
      - Nevertheless, when you call a method of a List interface in the first example, which was implemented in
      ArrayList, the method
      from ArrayList will be called (because the List interface doesn't implement any methods). That's called
      polymorphism. You can read up on it.
      <br>
      - The definition in Line 1 should always be preferred. Why though?
      <br>
      Almost always <code>List</code> is preferred over <code>ArrayList</code> because, for instance,
      <code>List</code> can be
      translated into a <code>LinkedList</code> without
      affecting the rest of the codebase. The only change that we will have to make in the codebase is change the
      Line1 to <code>new LinkedList&lt;SomeObject&gt()</code>.
      When you do, in fact, have to use methods that are specific ONLY to <code>ArrayList</code>, you can convert
      <code>List</code>
      to <code>ArrayList</code> very easily.
      Most common error is to accidentally use an ArrayList method, without that being necessary. Changing
      ArrayList to List or another List implementation is difficult.
      Something to note is that "ArrayList specific methods" isn't limited to just methods used in ArrayList, but
      their return types being changed as well.
      <br>
      - Occasionally, the application may require that you use methods in the ArrayList API that are not in the
      List API. For example,
      <code>ensureCapacity(int)</code>, <code>trimToSize()</code> or <code>removeRange(int, int)</code>. That is
      the only sound reason for coding to the class rather than the interface, <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279030/type-list-vs-type-arraylist-in-java">IMO</a>.
      <br>
      The above argument also holds for methods that operate on sets or return sets. They should specify
      parameters of type Set:

        SO post discussing the same thing</a>
      <br>
      Effective Java (Bloch): If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, and fields
      should all be declared using interface types.
      If you get into the habit of using interface types, your program will be much more flexible. It is entirely
      appropriate to refer to an
      object by a class if no appropriate interface exists.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">When will overriding methods not work</div>
    <div>
      - The methods that are overriding each other MUST have the same return type. If the return type is different, then the two methods neither override nor overload each
      other. <br>
      - However, the overriding method of the subclass CAN return an object that is the subclass of the object that is being returned from the superclass method that is being
      overridden. Doesn't make sense? Look at the below example:
      <div class="code-block">

        </div>
      </div>
      - Second, when overriding a method, we can increase access but we can never decrease access. Java specifies that the access specifier for an overriding method can allow
      more, but not less, access than the overridden method. For example, a <code>protected</code> instance method in the superclass can be made <code>public</code>, but not
      <code>private</code>, in the subclass.

    <div class="sub-heading">Using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods</div>
    <div>
      - You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the <code>abstract</code> type modifier.These methods are sometimes referred to as
      <i>subclasser responsibility</i> because these methods have no implementation specified in the superclass. Hence, a subclass MUST override them - it cannot simply use
      the version defined in the superclass. To declare an abstract method, use this general form: <code>abstract <i>type name (parameter-list);</i> </code>
      <br>
      Note the closing semi-colon. No method body is present. Abstract methods CANNOT have a body. Abstract classes can have concrete methods along with abstract methods
      though.
      <br>
      - Any class that contains one or more abstract methods MUST also be declared abstract. There can be no objects of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class cannot
      be instantiated using a <code>new</code> operator. Also, you cannot declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods. Any subclass of an abstract method must
      either implement all of the abstract methods or be declared <code>abstract</code> itself. <br>
      - Abstract classes/methods cannot be declared <code>final</code>. Abstract classes/methods cannot be declared <code>static</code> <br>
      - Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object references. <br>
      - To declare a class abstract, we use the <code>extends</code> keyword. Note that abstract classes are <i>extended</i> whereas interfaces are <i>implemented</i>.

      <div>
        - To disallow a method from being overridden, specify <code>final</code> as a modifier at the start of its declaration. Methods declared as <code>final</code>
        cannot be overridden. <br>
        - Methods declared as <code>final</code> can sometimes also provide performance enhancement by <i>inlining</i> calls to them. Normally, Java resolves calls to
        methods dynamically at run-time. This is called <i>late-binding</i>. However, since <code>final</code> methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved
        at compile time. This is called <i>early-binding</i>.

        - Sometimes, you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class
        declaration with <code>final</code>. Declaring a class as <code>final</code> implicitly declares all of
        its methods as <code>final</code> too.
        <br>
        - As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both <code>abstract</code> and

  <div id="interfaces" class="chapter">Chapter 9: Interfaces</div>
  <hr>

  <div class="textual-content">
    - Interfaces are syntactically similar to classes, but they lack instance variables. In practice, this means
    that you can define interfaces that don't make assumptions about how they are implemented. Once it is defined,
    any number of classes can implement an interface. Also, one class can implement any number of interfaces. <br>
    - Interfaces are designed to support dynamic method resolution at run time. Since interfaces are in a different
    hierarchy from classes, it is possible for classes that are unrelated in terms of the class hierarchy to
    implement the same interface. This is where the real power of interfaces is realized.

    <div class="sub-heading">Defining an Interface</div>
    <div>
      - When no access modifier is included, then default access results, and the interface is only available to
      other members of the package in which it is declared. When it is declared as <code>public</code>, the
      interface can be used by code outside its package. In this case, the interface must be the only public
      interface declared in the file, and the file must have the same name as the interface. <br>
      - Notice that the methods that are declared have no bodies. Beginning with JDK 8, it is possible to add a
      default implementation to an interface method. Furthermore, JDK 8 also added static interface methods, and
      beginning with JDK 9, an interface can include private methods. <br>
      - Variables can be declared inside interface declarations. They are implicitly <code>final</code> and <code>static</code>,
      meaning they cannot be changed by the implementing class. They must also be initialized. All methods and
      variables are implicitly <code>public</code>.

    <div class="sub-heading">Implementing Interfaces</div>
    <div>
      - Once an interface has been defined, one or more classes can implement that interface. To implement an
      interface, include the <code>implements</code> clause in a class definition, and then create the methods
      required by the interface. <br>
      - The general form of a class that includes the <code>implements</code> clause looks like this: <br>
      <code>class <i>className</i> [extends <i>superclassName</i>] implements <i>interface1, interface2</i></code>
      <code>{</code> <br>
      <code> // class methods</code> <br>
      <code>}</code> <br>
      - If a class implements more than one interface, the interfaces are separated with a comma. <br>
      - So what happens if a class implements two different interfaces and both of those interfaces happen to have
      the same method name with the same method signature? <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2801878/implementing-two-interfaces-in-a-class-with-same-method-which-interface-method">Source
      on SO</a>. Read both top 2 answers. <br>
      - The methods that implement an interface must be declared public. Also, the type signature of the
      implementing method must match exactly the type signature specified in the interface definition. <br>

    <div class="sub-heading">Accessing implementations through Interface references</div>
    <div>
      - Consider a Teacher class that implements the IPerson interface. <br>

        </div>
      </div>

      - Then the typical polymorphic properties work with interfaces as well:

        </div>
      </div>
      - If a class implements an interface but does not fully implement the methods required by that interface,
      then
      that class must be declared as <code>abstract</code>. Any class that inherits this abstract class must
      implement the methods in the interface or be declared <code>abstract</code> itself.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Nested Interfaces</div>
    <div>
      - An interface can be declared a member of a class or another interface. Such an interface is called a
      member interface or a nested interface. A nested interface can be declared as <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>,
      or <code>protected</code>.
      This differs from a top-level interface, which must either be declared as <code>public</code> or use the
      default access level, as previously described. When a nested interface is used outside of its enclosing
      scope, it must be qualified by the name of the class or interface of which it is a member. Thus, outside of
      the class or interface in which a nested interface is declared, its name must be fully qualified. <br>

    <div class="sub-heading">Variables in Interfaces</div>
    <div>
      - You can use interfaces to import shared constants into multiple classes by simply declaring an interface
      that contains variables that are initialized to the desired values. When you include that interface in a
      class (that is, when you "implement" the interface), all of those variable names will be in scope as
      constants. If an interface contains no methods, then any class that includes such an interface doesn't
      actually implement anything. It is as if that class were importing the constant fields into the class name
      space as final variables. <br>
      - But usage of constants in interfaces is controversial. Oh my! <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2659593/what-is-the-use-of-interface-constants">Here on SO</a>.

    <div class="sub-heading">Interface can be extended</div>
    <div>
      - One interface can inherit another by use of the keyword extends. The syntax is the same as for inheriting
      classes. When a class implements an interface that inherits another interface, it must provide
      implementations for all methods required by the interface inheritance chain.

    <div class="sub-heading">Default interface methods</div>
    <div>
      - It is important to point out that the addition of default methods does not change a key aspect of
      interface: its inability to maintain state information. An interface still cannot have instance variables,
      for example. Thus, the defining difference between an interface and a class is that a class can maintain
      state information, but an interface cannot. Furthermore, it is still not possible to create an instance of
      an interface by itself. It must be implemented by a class. Therefore, even though, beginning with JDK 8, an
      interface can define default methods, the interface must still be implemented by a class if an instance is
      to be created. <br>

    <div class="sub-heading">Multiple inheritance issues</div>
    <div>
      - Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. <br>
      - For example, assume that two interfaces called Alpha and Beta are implemented by a class called MyClass.
      What happens if both Alpha and Beta provide a method called reset() for which both declare a default
      implementation? Is the version by Alpha or the version by Beta used by MyClass? Or, consider a situation in
      which Beta extends Alpha. Which version of the default method is used? Or, what if MyClass provides its own
      implementation of the method? To handle these and other similar types of situations, Java defines a set of
      rules that resolves such conflicts. <br>
      - First, in all cases, a class implementation takes priority over an interface default implementation. Thus,
      if MyClass provides an override of the reset() default method, MyClass' version is used. This is the case
      even if MyClass implements both Alpha and Beta. In this case, both defaults are overridden by MyClass'
      implementation. <br>
      - Second, in cases in which a class implements two interfaces that both have the same default method, but
      the class does not override that method, then an error will result. Continuing with the example, if MyClass
      implements both Alpha and Beta, but does not override reset(), then an error will occur. <br>
      - In cases in which one interface inherits another, with both defining a common default method, the
      inheriting interface's version of the method takes precedence. Therefore, continuing the example, if Beta
      extends Alpha, then Beta's version of reset() will be used. <br>
      - It is possible to explicitly refer to a default implementation in an inherited interface by using this
      form of <code>super</code>. Its general form is shown here: <code>InterfaceName.super.methodName() </code>.

      - Consider the following class structure.
      <img src="imgs/Intefaces/MultipleInterfaces.png"

           alt="EmailMessagingService"

      - <i>SingleDataListBox</i> implements two interfaces, both of which declare the same method and the same method signature. Now when you override the <i>setValue()</i> method,
      in the <i>SingleDataListBox</i> class,
      the method from which of the two interfaces has been implemented? Both of them actually. Because from the compiler's perspective they are the same method. And there should be
      a single implementation for both of them. That is, there is only one <code>@Override</code> that will be necessary. The two methods have become 'override-equivalent'. Whether
      you treat the <i>SingleDataListBox</i> as a <i>HasValue</i> type, or a <i>SingleDataListBoxDisplay</i> type, there is only one method to invoke.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">What happens if a class extends a class and implements another interface but does not define some method in the interface</div>

    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Using static methods in an interface</div>
    <div>
      - Another capability added to interface by JDK 8 is the ability to define one or more <code>static</code>
      methods. Like <code>static</code> methods in a class, a <code>static</code> method defined by an interface
      can be called independently of any object. Thus, no implementation of the interface is necessary, and no
      instance of the interface is required, in order to call a static method. Instead, a static method is called
      by specifying the interface name, followed by a period, followed by the method name. <br>
      - <code>static</code> interface methods are not inherited by either an implementing class or a subinterface.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Private interface methods</div>
    <div>
      - Beginning with JDK 9, an interface can include a private method. A private interface method can be called
      only by a default method or another private method defined by the same interface. Because a private
      interface method is specified private, it cannot be used by code outside the interface in which it is
      defined. This restriction includes subinterfaces because a private interface method is not inherited by a
      subinterface. <br>
      - The key benefit of a private interface method is that it lets two or more default methods use a common
      piece of code, thus avoiding code duplication.

        - ArrayList has 3 constructors:
        <br>
        a) <code>ArrayList()</code>: Builds an empty Array List
        <br>
        b) <code>ArrayList(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt c)</code>: Builds an Array List that is initialized with
        the
        elements of the Collection c in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.
        <br>
        c) <code>ArrayList(int capacity)</code>: Builds an array list that has the specified initial capacity.
        The
        capacity is the size of the
        underlying array that is used to store the elements. The capacity grows automatically as elements are
        added to the array list.
        <br>
        You can increase the capacity of an ArrayList object manually by calling <code>ensureCapacity()</code>

        <code>ensureCapacity</code> doesn't change the logical size of an ArrayList - it changes the <code>capacity</code>,
        which is the size the list can reach
        before it next needs to copy values. You need to be very aware of the difference between a logical size
        (i.e. all the
        values in the range [0, size) are accessible, and adding a new element will add it at index size) and
        the capacity
        which is more of an implementation detail really - it's the size of the backing array used for storage.
        <br>
        Calling <code>ensureCapacity</code> should only ever make any difference in terms of performance (by
        avoiding
        excessive copying) -
        it doesn't affect the logical model of what's in the list, if you see what I mean.

        <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
        <br>
        The Linked List has 2 constructors:
        <br>
        a) <code>LinkedList()</code>: The first constructor builds an empty linked list.
        <br>
        b) <code>LinkedList(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt c)</code>: The second constructor builds a linked list
        that is initialized with the elements of the Collection c.
      </div>
      <div class="sub-heading">Linked List vs Array List</div>
      <div class="textual-content">
        From memory standpoint:
        <br>
        - Individual elements stored in a LinkedList takes more space than an ArrayList as LinkedList also needs
        to store the node information.
        To be clear, even in the worst case, ArrayList is 4x smaller than a LinkedList with the same elements.
        In short, it's basically impossible
        to make LinkedList win the memory comparison, and if you care about space, then calling
        <code>trimToSize()</code> on the ArrayList will instantly
        make ArrayList win again by a huge margin. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11564453/8742428">Seriously.
        ArrayList wins.</a>
        <br>
        - For a linked list, each node occupies AT LEAST 3 times the number of entries, because each node has a
        next and prev reference as well as the entry reference.
        (And in fact, it is more than 3 times, because of the space used by the nodes' object headers and
        padding. Depending on the JVM and pointer size,
        it can be as much as 6 times.) The only situation where a linked list will use less space than an array
        list is if
        you badly over-estimate the array list's initial capacity. (And for very small lists ...).
        When you think about it, the only real advantage linked lists have over array lists is when you are
        inserting and removing elements.
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11564490/8742428">Even then, it depends on how you do it.</a>

        ArrayList stores "references" or "pointers" to actual storage in an internal object array elementData.
        This array of references may well be contiguous,
        but is JVM specific. The actual objects being added are stored on the heap, and almost certainly won't

      <br>
      <code>HashSet</code> extends <code>AbstractSet</code> and implements the <code>Set</code> interface. It
      creates a collection
      that uses a hash table for storage.
      <code>HashSet</code> is a generic class that has this declaration: <code>class HashSet&lt;E&gt</code>.
      <br>
      - This class implements the <code>Set</code> interface, backed by a hash table (actually a
      <code>HashMap</code>
      instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set;
      in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. This class permits the
      null element.
      This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>,
      <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
      assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly
      among the buckets.
      <br>
      - Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of the HashSet instance's size (the number
      of elements) plus the "capacity" of the backing
      <code>HashMap</code> instance (the number of buckets). Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
      capacity
      too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.
      <br>
      The following constructors are defined:
      <br>
      a) <code>HashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has default initial
      capacity
      (16) and load factor (0.75).
      <br>
      b) <code>HashSet(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt c)</code>: Initializes the hash set by using the elements of
      c.
      <br>
      c) <code>HashSet(int capacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has the
      specified
      initial capacity and default load factor (0.75).
      <br>
      d) <code>HashSet(int capacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap
      instance
      has the specified initial capacity and the specified load factor (also called fillRatio)
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading"> 4) The LinkedHashSet Class</div>
    <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
      <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
      <br>
      The <code>LinkedHashSet</code> class extends <code>HashSet</code> and adds no members of its own. It is a
      generic class
      that has this declaration:
      <code>class LinkedHashSet&lt;E&gt</code>. Here, <code>E</code> specifies the type of objects that the set
      will hold. Its
      constructors parallel those in HashSet. Hash table and
      linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order. This implementation
      differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked
      list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is the order
      in which elements were inserted into the set (insertion-order).
      Note that insertion order is not affected if an element is re-inserted into the set.
      <br>
      (//TODO: But this should again run into the same problem that happens when we compare Linked List vs Array
      List. Linked Lists take way more memory. So I think LinkedHashSet should also end up taking an enormous
      chunk of memory )
      <br>
      Like HashSet, it provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>,
      <code>remove</code>,
      <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
      assuming the hash function disperses elements properly
      among the buckets.
      <br>
      - Performance is likely to be just slightly below that of HashSet, due to the added expense
      of maintaining the linked list, with one exception:
      Iteration over a LinkedHashSet requires time proportional to the <code>size</code> of the set, regardless of
      its
      <code>capacity</code>. Iteration over a HashSet is
      likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its capacity. This implementation spares its
      clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic
      ordering provided by HashSet, without incurring the increased cost associated with <code>TreeSet</code>.
      <br>
      Linked Hash Set has 4 Constructors:
      <br>
      a) <code>LinkedHashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the default initial capacity
      (16) and load
      factor (0.75).
      <br>
      b) <code>LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the
      specified initial capacity and the default load factor (0.75).
      <br>
      c) <code>LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash
      set with the
      specified initial capacity and load factor.
      <br>
      d) <code>LinkedHashSet(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt c)</code>: Constructs a new linked hash set with the
      same elements as
      the specified collection.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading"> 5) The TreeSet Class</div>
    <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
      <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
      <br>
      A <code>NavigableSet</code> implementation based on a <code>TreeMap</code>. The elements are ordered using
      their natural
      ordering, or by a <code>Comparator</code> provided at
      set creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed
      <i>log(n)</i> time cost for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code> and
      <code>contains</code>).
      Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent
      with equals</i> if it is to correctly implement
      the <i>Set</i> interface. (See <code>Comparable</code> or <code>Comparator</code> for a precise definition
      of consistent
      with equals.) This is so because the <code>Set</code>
      interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a <code>TreeSet</code> instance performs all
      element
      comparisons using its <code>compareTo</code> (or <code>compare</code>) method,
      so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the set, equal. The
      behavior of a set is well-defined even if its ordering is
      inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Set interface.
      <br>
      <code>TreeSet</code> has the following Constructors:
      <br>
      a) <code>TreeSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted in ascending order according to the
      natural ordering
      of its elements.
      <br>
      b) <code>TreeSet(Collection&lt; extends E&gt c)</code> : Constructs a new tree set containing the elements
      in the
      specified collection, sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements.
      <br>
      c) <code>TreeSet(Comparator&lt;? super E&gt comparator)</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted
      according to the
      specified comparator.
      <br>
      d) <code>TreeSet(SortedSet&lt;E&gt s)</code>: Constructs a new tree set containing the same elements and
      using the same
      ordering as the specified sorted set.

      - Iterators allow you to cycle through the elements in a collection. <code>iterator</code> allows you to
      cycle through a collection, obtaining and removing elements. <code>ListIterator</code> extends <code>Iterator</code>
      to
      allow bi-directional traversal of a list, and the modification of elements.
      <br>
      - The <code>Iterator</code> and the <code>ListIterator</code> are generic interfaces:
      <br>
      <code>interface Iterator &lt;E&gt</code>
      <br>
      <code>interface ListIterator &lt;E&gt</code>
      <br>
      Here <code>E</code> specifies the type of object being iterated.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-heading">Using an Iterator</div>
    <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
      Before you can access a collection through an iterator, you must obtain one. Each of the collection classes
      provides an
      <code>iterator()</code> method that returns an iterator to the start of the collection. By using this
      iterator
      object, you can access each element
      in the collection, one element at a time. In general, to use an iterator to cycle through the contents of a
      collection, follow these steps:
      <br>
      1. Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling the collection's <code>iterator()</code>
      method.
      <br>
      2. Set up a loop that makes a call to <code>hasNext()</code>. Have the loop iterate as long as <code>hasNext()</code>
      returns true.
      <br>
      3. Within the loop, obtain each element by calling <code>next()</code>.
      <br>
      For collections that implement List, you can also obtain an iterator by calling <code>listIterator()</code>.
      A list iterator gives you the ability to access the collection in either the forward or backward direction
      and lets you modify an element.
      Otherwise, <code>ListIterator</code> is used just like <code>Iterator</code>.

      - A <i>map</i> is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or <i>key/value</i> pairs.
      Given a key, you can find its value.
      Both keys and values are objects. The keys must be unique, but the values may be duplicated. Some maps can
      accept a null key and null values, others cannot.
      <br>
      - <code>Map</code> is generic and is declared as shown here: <code>interface Map &lt;K, V&gt</code>
      <br>
      Here <code>K</code> specifies the types of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the types of values.
      <br>
      - There is one key point about maps that is important to mention at the outset: they don't implement the
      <code>Iterable</code>
      interface.
      This means that you cannot cycle through a map using a for-each style for loop. Furthermore, you can't
      obtain an iterator to a map.
      However, you can obtain a collection-view of a map, which does allow the use of either the for loop or an
      iterator.
      <br>
      - The Map interface provides three <i>collection</i> views:
      <br>
      a) <code>Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt&gt entrySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the mappings
      contained in this
      map. The
      set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is
      modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove()
      operation,
      or through the setValue() operation on a map entry
      returned by the iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
      which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll,
      retainAll and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.
      <br>
      b) <code>Set&lt;K&gt keySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the keys contained in this map.
      <br>
      c) <code>Collection&lt;V&gt values()</code>: Returns a <code>Collection</code> view of the values contained
      in this map.
      <br>
      What's up with the 3 different return types?
      <br>

      <br>
      You should be careful about not changing the map while you are iterating over it. Read what it means to
      "change" the map on these SO links <a

      - The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views
      return their elements.
      Some map implementations, like the <code>TreeMap</code> class, make specific guarantees as to their order;
      others,
      like the <code>HashMap</code> class, do not.
      <br>
      - Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys. The behavior of a map is not
      specified if the value of an object is
      changed in a manner that affects <code>equals</code> comparisons while the object is a key in the map. A
      special
      case of this prohibition is that it is
      not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is permissible for a map to contain itself as
      a value, extreme caution is advised:
      the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods are no longer well defined on such a map.
      <br>
      - To put a value into a map, use <code>put(K key, V value)</code> specifying the key and the value.
      <code>get(Object key)</code> returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map
      contains
      no mapping for the key.

    <div class="sub-heading">The SortedMap Interface</div>
    <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
      <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
      <br>
      - The <code>SortedMap</code> interface extends <code>Map</code>. It ensures that entries are maintained in
      the ascending
      order according to their keys.
      - The map is ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a <code>Comparator</code>
      typically
      provided at sorted map creation time.
      This order is reflected when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
      <code>entrySet()</code>, <code>keySet()</code> and <code>values()</code> methods).
      (This interface is the map analogue of SortedSet.)
      <br>
      - <code>SortedMap</code> is generic and is declared here: <code>interface SortedMap&lt;K, V&gt</code>. Here
      <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
      <br>
      - All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface (or be accepted
      by the
      specified comparator).
      Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable: <i>k1.compareTo(k2)</i> (or <i>comparator.compare(k1,
      k2)</i>) must not throw a
      <i>ClassCastException</i> for any keys k1 and k2 in the sorted map.
      <br>
      - Sorted maps allow very efficient manipulations of submaps (in other words, subsets of a map). To obtain a
      submap, use
      <code>headMap()</code>, <code>tailMap()</code>, or <code>subMap()</code>. The submap returned by these
      methods is backed by
      the invoking map.
      Changing one changes the other. To get the first key in the set, call <code>firstKey()</code>. To get the
      last
      key, use <code>lastKey()</code>.

      The NavigableMap interface extends <code>SortedMap</code> and declares the behavior of a map that supports
      the
      retrieval of entries based on the closest match to a given key or keys.
      <br>
      - <code>NavigableMap</code> is a generic interface that has
      this declaration: <code>interface NavigableMap&lt;K,V&gt</code>. Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of

    <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
      <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
      <br>
      - The <code>Map.Entry</code> interface enables you to work with a map entry. For example, recall that the
      <code>entrySet()</code>
      method declared by the <code>Map</code> interface returns a <code>Set</code> containing the map entries.
      Each of these
      set elements is a <code>Map.Entry</code> object.
      <br>
      - <code>Map.Entry</code> is generic and is declared like this: <code>interface Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt</code>.
      Here <code>K</code>
      specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of Values.
      <br>
      - Map.Entry is a key and its value combined into one class. This allows you to iterate over <code>Map.entrySet()</code>
      instead of having to iterate over <code>Map.keySet()</code>, then getting the value for each key.

      <code>AbstractMap</code> is a superclass for all concrete Map implementations. The concrete implementations
      are the following

      <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
      <br>
      The <code>HashMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>Map</code>
      interface. It uses a hash table to store the map. This allows the execution time of <code>get()</code> and
      <code>put()</code> to remain constant even for large sets. Remember that the <code>put()</code> method
      automatically replaces any preexisting value that is associated with the specified key with the new value.
      <code>HashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
      <br>
      <code>class HashMap&lt;K, V&gt</code>. Here <code>K</code> specifies the type of the key, and <code>V</code>specifies
      the type of the Value.
      <br>
      The following Constructors are defined:
      <br>
      a) <code>HashMap</code>: Constructs a default Hash Map
      <br>
      b) <code>HashMap(Map &lt;? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes the Hash Map by using the
      elements of m
      <br>
      c) <code>HashMpa(int capacity)</code>: Initializes the capacity of the Hash map to <i>capacity</i>.
      <br>
      d) <code>HashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: Initializes both the <i>capacity</i> and the <i>fillRatio</i>
      by using the arguments.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-heading">2) The TreeMap Class</div>
    <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
      <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
      <br>
      The <code>TreeMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>NavigableMap</code>
      interface. It creates maps stored in a tree structure. A <code>TreeMap</code> provides an efficient means of
      storing
      key/value pairs in sorted order and allows rapid retrieval. You should note that, unlike a hash map, a tree
      map guarantees that its elements will be sorted in ascending key order. <code>TreeMap</code> is a generic
      class that has
      this declaration: <code>class TreeMap&lt;K, V&gt</code> Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and
      <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
      <br>
      The <code>TreeMap</code> constructors are:
      <br>
      a) <code>TreeMap</code>: Constructs an empty tree map that will be sorted by using the natural order of its
      keys.
      <br>
      b) <code>TreeMap(Comparator &lt;? super K&gt comp)</code>: Constructs an empty tree-based map that will be
      sorted by using the
      <code>Comparator</code> comp.
      <br>
      c) <code>TreeMap(Map &lt;? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries
      from
      m, which will be sorted by using the natural order of the keys.
      <br>
      d) <code>TreeMap(SortedMap &ltK, ? extends V &gt sm)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries from
      <i>sm</i>, which will be sorted in the same order as <i>sm</i>.
      <br>
      Notice that <code>TreeMap</code> sorts the keys. However, in this case, they are sorted by first name
      instead of last name. You can alter this behavior by specifying a comparator when the map is created.

    <div class="sub-heading">3) The LinkedHashMap Class</div>
    <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
      <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
      <br>
      <code>LinkedHashMap</code> extends <code>HashMap</code>. It maintains a linked list of the entries in the
      map, in the order in which they were inserted. This allows insertion-order iteration over the map. That is,
      when iterating through a collection-view of a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, the elements will be returned in
      the order in
      which they were inserted. You can also create a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> that returns its elements in the
      order in
      which they were last accessed.
      <br>
      <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
      <code>class LinkedHashMap&ltK,V&gt</code>.
      Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
      <br>
      LinkedHashMap defines the following constructors:
      <br>
      a) <code>LinkedHashMap()</code>: Constructs a default Linked Hash Map
      <br>
      b) <code>LinkedHashMap(Map&lt? extends K, ? extends V&gt m)</code>: initializes the LinkedHashMap with the
      elements from <i>m</i>.
      <br>
      c) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity)</code>: initializes the capacity.
      <br>
      d) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: initializes both capacity and fill ratio. The
      meaning of capacity and fill ratio are the same as for HashMap. The default capacity is 16. The default
      ratio is 0.75.
      <br>
      e) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio, boolean Order)</code>: allows you to specify whether
      the elements will be stored in the linked list by insertion order, or by order of last access. If
      <i>Order</i> is
      true, then access order is used. If <i>Order</i> is false, then insertion order is used.

    - Collections are designed to work only with objects. To work with collections of primitive types, either you wrap and unwrap your primitive values in wrapper objects or
    you can take advantage of the built-in autoboxing features in Java that will wrap and unwrap the primitive values as needed. <br>
    - All collection classes in Java are declared generic. That is, you can specify the type of elements that your collection deals with as the type parameter. <br>

    <div class="sub-heading">The <code>Collection</code> Interface</div>
    <div>
      - The <code>Collection</code> interface is the root of the collection interface hierarchy. It defines a generic collection. The Collections Framework does not provide
      an implementation for the Collection interface. <br>
      - This is the most generic type of collection. You can use it as an argument type in methods, where you do not care about the collection type of the argument, provided
      it isn't a map. <br>
      - Note the <code>add()</code> and the <code>remove()</code> methods in the <code>Collection</code> interface. Both of them return true if calling them on the collection
      ended up changing the collection. Otherwise they return false. For eg, in the case of a <code>Set</code> trying to add an element that already exists in the set is
      going to return false. Similarly, trying to remove an element from a collection that does not exist returns false. <br>
      - We need a way to bridge the gap between array and Collections. We need a way to easily convert <i>Foo[]</i> to <i>Collection&lt;Foo&gt;</i>. There are two ways to
      accomplish this, as shown in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51545469/8742428">this answer on SO</a>. <br>
      a) Converting a <code>Collection</code> to an <code>array</code>: you can use the <a
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html#toArray(T%5B%5D)"><code>toArray</code></a> method provided in the
      <code>Collection</code> interface to convert the collection into an array. <br>
      <code>Foo[] foos = fooCollection.toArray(new Foo[0]); // before JDK 11</code> <br>
      <code>Foo[] updatedFoos = fooCollection.toArray(Foo[]::new); // after JDK 11</code> <br>
      b) Converting an <code>array</code> to a <code>Collection</code>: There is no method on the <code>Collection</code> interface to directly convert arrays into
      collections. Instead you will have to do this individually for the specific collection that you are trying to obtain. <br>
      <code>List&lt;Foos&gt; fooList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(fooArray))</code> <br>
      <code>Set&lt;Foos&gt; fooSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(fooArray))</code> <br>
      The exception to the rule here is that you cannot convert an array of a primitive type directly to a collection. You will have to iterate over each element. <br>
      - There is also the <code>Collections</code> Utility class that offers multiple methods for performing operations on different types of <code>Collection</code> and
      <code>Map</code>. Read about that on the <a href="../LeetCode/LeetCode.html">other page here</a>.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Traversing Collections</div>
    <div>
      - The <code>Iterator</code> is the fundamental (and a little cumbersome) way of iterating over elements of a collection. It has existed since the beginning. All other
      ways, such as the for-each loop, the <code>forEach()</code> method, and the <code>forEachRemaining()</code> method, are syntactic sugar for the <code>Iterator</code>.
      Internally, they all use an <code>Iterator</code>. <br>

      <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">a) Using an <code>Iterator</code></p>: <br>
      - A collection provides an iterator to iterate over all its elements. Sometimes an iterator is also known as a <i>generator</i> or a <i>cursor</i>. <br>
      - An iterator lets you perform the following three operations on a collection: <br>
      i) Check if there are elements that have not been yet accessed using this iterator. <br>
      ii) Access the next element in the collection. <br>
      iii) Remove the last accessed element of the collection. <br>
      - Note that you cannot add elements to a collection using the <code>Iterator</code> interface, only remove elements. If you want to add elements as well, you can do it
      with a <code>ListIterator</code> interface (obviously, this will work only with lists). <br>
      - The meaning of the term "next element" of a collection depends on the collection type. The iterator itself does not impose any ordering in which it returns the
      elements from a collection. However, if the collection imposes ordering on its elements, the iterator will maintain the same ordering. In general, the "next element"
      means any element in the collection that has not been returned by this iterator yet. <br>
      - The <code>remove()</code> method removes the element of the collection that was returned last time by calling the <code>next()</code> method of the iterator. The
      <code>remove()</code> method can be called only once per call to the <code>next()</code> method. If the <code>remove()</code> method is called more than once per
      <code>next()</code>
      method call or before the first call to the <code>next()</code> method, it throws an <code>IllegalStateException</code>. The support for the <code>remove()</code>
      method is optional. Calling the <code>remove()</code> method of an iterator may throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if the iterator does not support the
      remove operation. <br>
      - The Collections Framework supports fast-fail concurrent iterators. You can obtain multiple iterators for a collection and all of them can be used to iterate over the
      same collection concurrently. If the collection is modified by any means, except using the <code>remove()</code> method of the same iterator after the iterator is
      obtained, the attempt to access the next element using the iterator will throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>. It means that you can have multiple
      iterators for a collection; however, all iterators must be accessing (reading) elements of the collection. If any of the iterators modify the collection using its
      <code>remove()</code> method, the iterator that modifies the collection will be fine and all other iterators will fail. If the collection is modified outside of all
      iterators, all iterators will fail.

      </div>

      <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">b) Using a <code>for-each</code> loop</p>: <br>
      - The for-each loop is not a replacement for using an iterator. <br>
      - The for-each loop has several limitations. You cannot use the for-each loop to remove elements from the collection. Another limitation of the for-each loop is that
      you
      must traverse from the first element to the last element of the collection. It provides no way to start from middle of the collection. The for-each loop provides no way
      to
      visit the previously visited elements, which is allowed by the iterator of some collection types such as lists.<br>

      <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">c) Using a <code>forEach()</code> method</p>: <br>
      - The forEach() method is available in all collection types that inherit from the Collection interface. <br>
      - Remember that the args of the <code>forEach</code> requires a <code>Consumer</code>.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Working with Sets</div>
    <div>
      - Java allows at most one <code>null</code> element in a Set because one null element is still distinguishable from all other non-null elements and thus, it is unique.
      <br>
      - Go through the basics of <code>Set</code> <a href="../LeetCode/LeetCode.html#LC_HashSet">explained here on the other page</a>. <br>
      - Sometimes when you pass your Set to another method as an args, you may not want that method to modify your set in any way. In this case you can do the following:

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Using the <code>SortedSet</code> interface</div>
    <div>
      - A sorted set is a set that imposes ordering on its elements. An instance of the SortedSet interface represents a sorted set. <br>
      - The elements in a <code>SortedSet</code> can be sorted in a natural order or using a <code>Comparator</code>. A <code>SortedSet</code> must know how to sort its
      elements as they are added. The sorted set relies on two things to sort its elements: <br>
      a) If its elements implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface, it will use the <code>compareTo()</code> method of elements to sort them. This is called sorting in
      natural order. <br>
      b) You can supply a <code>Comparator</code> object to use a custom sorting. The implementation class for <code>SortedSet</code> is recommended to provide a constructor
      that will accept a <code>Comparator</code> object to use a custom sorting. If a <code>Comparator</code> is specified, the <code>Comparator</code> is used for sorting
      irrespective of the elements implementing the <code>Comparable</code> interface. <br>
      - What would happen if the class of the elements of a <code>SortedSet</code> does not implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface and you don't supply a
      <code>Comparator</code>
      object? The answer is that, in such cases, you cannot add any elements to a <code>SortedSet</code>. Attempting to add an element results in a
      <code>ClassCastException</code>. <br>
      - The <code>TreeSet</code> class is one of the predefined implementation classes for the <code>SortedSet</code> interface in the Collections Framework. <br>
      - Read through the behavior of the <code>TreeSet</code> when we try to store <code>String</code>s into it and also pass in a custom <code>Comparator</code> of our own
      <a href="../LeetCode/LeetCode.html#LC_HashSet">here on the other page</a>. <br>

      </div>

      - How is a <code>null</code> element stored in a <code>SortedSet</code>? If a <code>SortedSet</code> uses natural order (uses the <code>Comparable</code> interface's
      <code>compareTo()</code> method), adding a <code>null</code> element will throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>. If you use a <code>Comparator</code> object to
      apply the ordering, it is up to you to allow a null element in the <code>SortedSet</code>. If you allow a null element in the <code>SortedSet</code>, you can decide
      whether the null element will be placed in the beginning or at the end of the Set. <br>
      - There is a separate method in the <code>Comparator</code> interface that can place nulls at the start or end as per your requirement:
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#nullsFirst-java.util.Comparator-"><code>nullsFirst</code></a> or
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#nullsLast-java.util.Comparator-"><code>nullsLast</code></a>. Usage shown in above code
      example.
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Using the <code>NavigableSet</code> interface</div>
    <div>
      - A navigable set is a specialized type sorted set that lets you work with its subsets in a variety of ways. (emphasize again that this will also sort the contents like
      a <code>SortedSet</code> does). <br>
      - The <code>NavigableSet</code> interface inherits from the <code>SortedSet</code> interface and defines some additional methods to extend the functionality provided by
      the <code>SortedSet</code>. It extends <code>SortedSet</code> in four ways: <br>
      a) It lets you navigate the set in reverse order. The reverse order is the opposite order in which your <code>SortedSet</code> would be sorted normally. Its
      <code>descendingSet()</code> method returns a <code>NavigableSet</code> object, which is another view of the same <code>NavigableSet</code> in the reverse order. If you
      modify the original <code>NavigableSet</code> or the one returned from the <code>descendingSet()</code> method, the modifications will be reflected in both sets. <br>
      b) It adds another version of the three methods <code>headSet()</code>, <code>tailSet()</code>, and <code>subSet()</code> in <code>SortedSet</code>, which accept a
      boolean flag to include the element at the beginning or the end of the subset boundary. <br>
      c) It provides four methods, <code>lower()</code>, <code>floor()</code>, <code>higher()</code>, and <code>ceiling()</code>, that are used to search for an element based
      on search criteria. The <code>lower()</code> method returns the greatest element in the <code>NavigableSet</code> that is less than the specified element. The
      <code>floor()</code>
      method is similar to the <code>lower()</code> method that returns the greatest element in the <code>NavigableSet</code> that is less than or equal to the specified
      element. The <code>higher()</code> method returns the least element in the <code>NavigableSet</code> that is greater than the specified element. The
      <code>ceiling()</code> method is similar to the <code>higher()</code> method that returns the least element in the <code>NavigableSet</code> that is greater than or
      equal to a specified element. <br>
      d) It provides two methods, <code>pollFirst()</code> and <code>pollLast()</code>, that retrieve and remove the first and the last element of the
      <code>NavigableSet</code>, respectively. If the <code>NavigableSet</code> is empty, they return null. <br>
      - The <code>TreeSet</code> class is one of the implementation classes for the <code>NavigableSet</code> interface. Since a <code>NavigableSet</code> is also a
      <code>SortedSet</code> and a <code>SortedSet</code> is also a <code>Set</code>, you can use an object of <code>TreeSet</code> as a set, a sorted set, and a navigable
      set.

    <div>
      - Read the basics of operations that can be performed on a list <a href="../LeetCode/LeetCode.html#LC_Lists">here on the other page</a>. <br>
      - A <code>List</code> lets you iterate over its elements using a specialized iterator represented by an instance of the <code>ListIterator</code> interface. The
      <code>ListIterator</code> interface inherits the <code>Iterator</code> interface; it adds a few more methods to give you access to elements in the list from the current
      position in the backward direction. <br>
      - <code>List</code> has two implementations that are primarily used: <code>LinkedList</code> and <code>ArrayList</code>. Note that for the <code>LinkedList</code>, the
      list is implemented as a Doubly-Linked list. What this means is that fetching the last element is also going to take O(1) time and not O(n). In general, operations that
      index into the list will traverse the list from the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index. (<a

    <div id="java8queues" class="sub-heading">Working with Queues</div>
    <div>
      - A queue has two ends known as head and tail. In the simple queue, objects are added to the tail and removed from the head; the object added first will be removed
      first. <br>
      - Remember that <code>Queue</code> extends the <code>Collection</code> interface. So all of the methods in the <code>Collection</code> interface can also be accessed in
      the <code>Queue</code> interface as well. Things like <code>isEmpty</code> for example. <br>
      - Queues can be categorized based on the way it allows insertion and removal of its elements: <br>
      a) Simple Queue: allows insertion at the tail and removal from the head. <br>
      b) Priority Queue: associates a priority with every element of the queue and allows the element with the highest priority to be removed next from the queue. <br>
      c) Delay Queue: associates a delay with every element of the queue and allows for the removal of the element only when its delay has elapsed. <br>
      d) Doubly-Ended Queue: allows for insertion and removal of its elements from the head as well as the tail. <br>
      e) Blocking Queue: blocks the thread that adds elements to it when it is full and it blocks the thread removing elements from it when it is empty. <br>
      f) Transfer Queue: a special type of blocking queue where a handoff of an object occurs between two threads (a producer and a consumer). <br>
      g) Blocking Doubly Ended Queue: combination of a doubly ended queue and a blocking queue. <br>
      - The <code>Queue</code> interface itself has 3 implementations that you can use depending on your requirement:

      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="sub-heading">Simple Queues</div>
    <div>
      - Although the <code>Deque</code> interface also allows us to define a Queue, we should use the <code>Queue</code> interface to create a queue. For a stack you should
      prefer the <code>Deque</code> interface over the <code>Stack</code> class (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html">Source on Oracle
      Docs</a>) <br>
      - Simple queues are represented by an instance of the <code>Queue</code> interface. Objects are added to the tail and removed from the head. FIFO. <br>
      - Typically, a <code>null</code> element does not make sense in a <code>Queue</code>. After all, the purpose of having a queue is to apply some processing logic on its
      elements or use the elements to perform some logic. In either case, a <code>null</code> value does not make sense. It is up to the implementation of the
      <code>Queue</code> interface to allow or disallow <code>null</code> values. The use of <code>null</code> elements in a queue is not recommended. If you use
      <code>null</code> elements in a queue, you will not be able to distinguish between the <code>null</code> value returned from its method to indicate a special situation
      and the <code>null</code> value of the element. <br>
      - There are two implementations of the <code>Queue</code> interface that can be used as a simple queue - FIFO operations basically. These are <code>LinkedList</code>
      and <code>ArrayDeque</code>. You should prefer the <code>ArrayDeque</code> implementation instead of the <code>LinkedList</code> one. Reasons are present on the
      following SO links: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6163166/why-is-arraydeque-better-than-linkedlist">Why is ArrayDeque better than LinkedList</a>,
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6129805/what-is-the-fastest-java-collection-with-the-basic-functionality-of-a-queue">What is the fastest Java collection
        with the basic functionality of a Queue?</a> <br>

      - A queue lets you perform 3 basic operations: <br>
      a) Add an element to its tail <br>
      b) Remove an element from its head <br>
      c) Peek the element at the head <br>
      - The <code>Queue</code> interface defines two methods for each of these operations. One method throws an exception if the operation is not possible; the other method
      returns a value (<code>false</code> or <code>null</code>) to indicate the failure.

    <div class="sub-heading">Priority Queue</div>
    <div>
      - <code>PriorityQueue</code> is another implementation of the <code>Queue</code> interface. In a priority queue, each element is associated with a priority. The element
      with the highest priority is removed next from the queue. But what is "highest priority"? The head of this queue is the <i>least</i> element with respect to the
      specified ordering. If multiple elements are tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are broken arbitrarily.<br>
      - You can use the natural order of the elements in the queue as a priority. In that case, the elements should implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface. <br>
      - You can also supply a <code>Comparator</code> object, which will determine the priority of the elements. You can read about how to make use of <code>Comparable</code>
      and <code>Comparator</code> <a href="../ThingsToRemember/ThingsToRemember.html#num40">here on the other page</a>. <br>
      - In the output of the below code, note that the elements within the Priority Queue are not in any specific order. The only guarantee is that the call to
      <code>peek</code> or <code>remove</code> is going to return the correct element based on the priority that you have specified. The <code>PriorityQueue</code> class does
      not guarantee any ordering of the elements when you use an iterator.

      - A doubly ended queue or deque is an extended version of a queue to allow insertion and removal of elements from both ends (the head and the tail). <br>
      - There are some new methods that are offered by the <code>Deque</code> interface to facilitate insertion, removal, and peeking at either end (head or tail) of a

      - You can get a read-only view (also called unmodifiable view) of a collection. This is useful when you want to pass around your collection to other methods and you do
      not want the called method to modify your collection. In such cases, you need to pass a read-only view of your collection to those methods.

    <div class="sub-heading">Creating Empty Collections</div>

      - Sometimes you need to call a method that accepts a collection. However, you do not have any elements for the collection to pass. In such cases, you do not need to go
      through the hassle of creating a collection object. The Collections class provides an immutable empty collection object of each type as a return value of its static
      methods. <br>
      - You can return these datastructures instead of returning <code>null</code> or you can pass these into a method that needs one of these datastructures. The size of all
      these is going to be 0. Also, all of these are immutable. So the method to which you will be passing these to won't be able to make any changes to them.

      argument and you have only one object to pass to that method. Instead of going through the hassle of creating a new collection and adding a lone element to it, you can
      use one of the three static methods of the Collections class, which will create an <i>immutable</i> collection with the one specified element.

    <div class="sub-heading">Understanding Hash-Based Collections</div>
    <div>
      - Two methods in the <code>Object</code> class are central to the working of hash-based collections. Those methods are <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code>.
      <br>
      - Hash-based collections maintain a number of buckets to store objects. When you add an object to a hash-based collection, Java gets the hash code value of the object
      by calling object's <code>hashCode()</code> method. Then, it applies an algorithm to the hash code value to compute the bucket in which the object should be placed.
      When you want to check if an object exists in a hash-based collection, Java applies the same logic to compute the bucket in which the object might have been placed. It
      calls the <code>hashCode()</code> method of the object and applies some algorithm to computethe bucket in which it might have been placed. Then, it uses the
      <code>equals()</code> method of the object to compare the object with existing objects in the bucket to check if the object exists in that bucket. <br>
      - It is easy to screw-up the implementation of the <code>hashCode()</code> and the <code>equals()</code> method. Below is an example of how NOT to implement these
      methods. <br>
      - The problem with the below class is that it is a <i>mutable</i> class. You can modify the <i>id</i> field of the class by calling the <i>setId</i> method. And you are
      using the same <i>id</i> field to calculate the hash code of the object as well. Hence if you mutate the id field after you have added the object to a hash-based DS
      like HashSet and then check for <code>contains</code>, you are going to get false. Because when you stored the object into the Hash Set, the bucket was calculated using
      the hash code, and the hash code was in turn calculated using the <i>id</i> field which was 300. But then you changed the <i>id</i> field to 200. So now when you check
      for <code>contains</code>, the bucket number to check for the existence of the object will be calculated based on the <i>new</i> hash code that has been calculated
      using the mutated <i>id</i> field value of 200. And sure enough the Hash Set is NOT going to find the object in that particular bucket, and it is going to return false
      as a result of that. <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/3780b491c1946e750e03f87ca08bdc3d.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>
      - Note that in the auto-generated <code>hashCode</code> method, there are two different methods that can be used for calculating the hash code of an object
      <code>Objects.hash()</code> and <code>Objects.hashCode()</code>. There is also a third method that can be used for calculating the hash code of an object, and that is
      by calling the <code>hashCode()</code> method directly on the object reference itself, as in <code>int hc = myObject.hashCode()</code>. <br>
      - So what is the difference between the 3 methods? Read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11656642/8742428">here on SO</a>. Basically: <br>
      a) <code>Objects.hash(Object... values)</code> should be used in cases when you want a hash of a sequence of objects, e.g. when defining your own hashCode method and
      want a simply-coded hash for multiple values that make up the identity of your object. <br>
      b) <code>Objects.hashCode(Object o)</code> should be used when you want the hash of a single object, without throwing NPE if the object is null. <br>
      c) <code>Object::hashCode()</code> should be used when you want the hash of a single object, and will throw an exception if the object is null. <br>
      - Point to note is that: <code>hash(o)</code> and <code>hashCode(o)</code> won't necessarily return the same thing! If you're doing it for a single object, you should
      probably use <code>hashCode</code>. This is because <code>Objects.hash</code> just calls <code>Arrays.hashCode</code> and the hashCode of a single object is different
      from the hashCode of an array with that single object in it. This in turn is because the <code>Objects.hash(Object... values)</code> method has two phases. First it
      will call <code>.hashCode</code> on each passed object, collecting each result. Then it will calculate another hash on the collected results. If you pass a single
      object, <code>Objects.hash(myObject)</code>, first <code>myObject.hashCode</code> is called and collected, and then a hash on that single-item collection is calculated.
      So, you end up with a hash of a hash. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/52654058/8742428">Source here on SO</a>. <br>
      - You can also see the same thing when you use the Auto Code Completion in Intellij. <br>
      - Asked a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68696328/is-the-automatic-hashcode-method-generation-in-intellij-broken">question here on SO</a>. Waiting for it
      to be downvoted to hell and back. <br>

    <div class="sub-heading">What is a Lambda Expression</div>
    <div>
      - A Lambda Expression is an unnamed block of code with a list of formal parameters and a body. An arrow
      <code>-></code> is used to separate the list of the parameters and the <i>body</i> of the lambda expression.
      <br>
      - A Lambda Expression represents an <i>instance</i> of a <i>functional interface</i>. Every expression in
      Java needs to have a type. This is its type. <br>
      - When the abstract method of a functional interface is called, it is the body of the lambda expression that
      is executed. <br>
      - A lambda expression is evaluated to an instance of a functional interface. The body
      of the lambda expression is not executed when the expression is evaluated. <i>The body of the lambda
      expression is
      executed when the method of the functional interface is invoked.</i> <br>
      - Consider the following lambda expression: <code>(String str) -> str.length</code>. What should be the type
      of this Lambda Expression? We cannot say for sure, because it's type can be <i>any </i> interface that takes
      a String as an input and returns an int. The following interface can be the type of this lambda expression:
      <br>
      <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> <br>
      <code>interface StringToIntMapper{</code> <br>
      <code> int strToInt(String s);</code> <br>
      <code>}</code> <br>
      In the above example, whenever the <code>strToInt</code> method of the interface will be called, the lambda
      expression above will be executed.
      <br>
      - The following code snippet shows an example of everything put together:

      - Java is a strongly-typed language, which means that the compiler must know the type of all expressions
      used
      in a Java program. a lambda expression by itself does not have a type, and therefore, it cannot be used as a
      standalone
      expression. The type of a lambda expression is always inferred by the compiler by the context in which it is
      used. <br>

      <li><p class="inline-heading">What is functional programming</p>: block of code that accepts values, known as parameters, and the
        block of
        code is executed to compute a result. Order of execution of functions does not matter in Functional
        programming since, unlike object-oriented programming, there is no state of the object that is being
        changed. <a href="https://openhome.cc/eGossip/Blog/index.html">Link to some explanation about FP</a>

      - These are some things that you can do with the body of the lambda expressions. <br>
      - The body of a lambda expression can be a block statement or a single expression. A block statement is
      enclosed in braces; a single expression is not enclosed in braces.

    <div class="sub-heading">Target Typing</div>
    <div>
      - There are two kinds of expressions in Java: <br>
      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Standalone Expressions</p>: A standalone expression is an expression whose type can be determined by
        the expression without knowing the context of its use. <code>new String("Hello")</code>,
        <code>"Hello"</code>, <code>new ArrayList&ltString&gt()</code>. The types are String, String, and
        ArrayList&ltString&gt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="inline-heading">Poly Expressions</p>: A poly expression is an expression that has different types in different
        contexts. All lambda expressions in Java are poly expressions. You must use it in a context to know its
        type. For example, the expression <code>new ArrayList&lt&gt()</code> is a poly expression. <br>
        In this:
        <code>ArrayList&ltLong&gt idList = new ArrayList&lt&gt();</code>, its type is
        <code>ArrayList&ltLong&gt</code>. <br>
        Whereas in <code>ArrayList&ltString&gt nameList = new ArrayList&lt&gt();</code>, its type is <code>ArrayList&ltString&gt</code>
      </li>
      - The compiler infers the type of a lambda expression. The context in which a lambda expression is used
      expects a type, which is called the
      <i>target type</i>. The process of inferring the type of a lambda expression from the context is known as
      <i>target typing</i>.

    <div class="sub-heading">Behavior Parameterization</div>
    <div>
      - Changing the behavior of a method through its parameters is known as behavior parameterization. This is
      also known as passing code as data because you pass code (logic, functionality, or behavior) encapsulated in
      lambda expressions to methods as if it is data. <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>
      - In the above example, instead of passing the lambda expression directly as a parameter, you could have
      assigned it to a variable of the desired type (<code>AnotherJoiner</code> in this case) and passed that
      variable as an argument instead.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Which contexts can a Lambda Expression be used</div>
    <div>
      - Lambda expressions can be used only in the following contexts:
      <li>
        <i>Assignment Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear to the right-hand side of the assignment
        operator in an assignment statement.
        For example: <code>ReferenceType variable1 = LambdaExpression;</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Method Invocation Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear as an argument to a method or
        constructor call.
        For example: <code>behavParam.testJoiner(LambdaExpression);</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Return Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear in a return statement inside a method, as its
        target type is the declared return type of the method.
        For example: <code>return LambdaExpression;</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Cast Context</i>: A lambda expression may be used if it is preceded by a cast. The type specified in
        the cast is its target type. <br>
        For example: <code>(Joiner) LambdaExpression;</code>
      </li>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Functional Interfaces</div>
    <div>
      - A functional interface is simply an interface that has exactly one abstract method. <br>
      - The following types of methods in an interface do not count for defining a functional interface: <br>
      <li>
        Default Methods: Recall
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html">default methods</a>
        were methods added to an interface that were not abstract. That is, a default
        method has an implementation right there in the interface itself.
      </li>
      <li>Static Methods (remember that a method defined as <code>static</code> in an interface also needs to be
        implemented right there in the interface itself.)
      </li>
      <li>Public methods inherited from the <code>Object</code> class</li>

    <div class="sub-heading">Method References</div>
    <div>
      - A method reference is shorthand to create a lambda expression using an existing method. <br>
      - Using method references makes your lambda expressions more readable and concise; <i>it also lets you use
      the existing methods</i>.
      <br>
      - If a lambda expression contains a body that is an expression using a method call, you can use a method
      reference in place of that lambda expression. <br>
      - The general syntax for a method reference is: <code>&ltQualifier&gt::&ltMethodName&gt</code>. The
      <code>Qualifier</code> depends on the type of the method reference. The <code>MethodName</code> is the name
      of the method. <br>
      - The syntax for method references allows specifying only the method name. You cannot specify the parameter
      types and return type of the method. Recall that a method reference is shorthand for a lambda expression.
      The target type, which is always a functional interface, determines the method's details. If the method is
      an overloaded method, the compiler will choose the most specific method based on the context. <br>
      - A method reference does not call the method when it is declared. The method is called later when the
      method
      of its target type is called.

    <div class="sub-heading">Constructor References</div>
    <div>
      - Sometimes the body of a lambda expression may be just an object creation expression. <br>
      - The syntax for using a constructor is: <code>ClassName::new</code> or <code>ArrayTypeName::new</code>.
      <br>
      - The <code>ClassName</code> is the name of the class that is to be instantiated. It cannot be the name of
      an abstract class.
      <br>
      - The keyword <code>new</code> refers to the constructor of the class. <br>
      - A class may have multiple constructors. The syntax does not provide a way to refer to a specific
      constructor. The compiler selects a specific constructor based on the context. It looks at the target type
      and the number of arguments in the abstract method of the target type. The constructor whose number of
      arguments matches with the number of arguments in the abstract method of the target type is chosen. <br>

    <div>
      - A scope is the part of a Java program within which a name can be referred to without using a qualifier.
      Classes and
      methods define their own scope. Scopes may be nested. <br>
      - Even though a lambda expression looks like a method declaration, it does not define a scope of its own. It
      exists in its enclosing scope. This is known as <i>lexical scoping</i> for lambda expressions. For example,
      when a lambda
      expression is used inside a method, the lambda expression exists in the scope of the method. <br>
      - The meanings of the keywords <code>this</code> and <code>super</code> are the same inside the lambda
      expression and its enclosing
      method. Note that this is different from the meanings of these keywords inside a local and anonymous inner
      class in
      which the keyword <code>this</code> refers to the current instance of the local and anonymous inner class,
      not its enclosing class. <br>
      - Lexical scoping of a lambda expression means that variables declared in the lambda expression, including
      its
      parameters, exist in the enclosing scope. Simple names in a scope must be unique. It means that a lambda
      expression
      cannot redefine variables with the same name that already exist in the enclosing scope.

      - A lambda expression can access instance and class variables of a class whether they are effectively final or not. If instance and class variables are not final, they
      can be modified inside the body of the lambda expressions. A lambda expression keeps a copy of the local variables used in its body. If the local variables are
      reference variables, a copy of the references is kept, not a copy of the objects.

      - The semantics of <code>this</code> is actually one of the areas where Java lambdas differ from anonymous
      implementations of interfaces. An anonymous interface implementation can have its own instance variables
      which are referenced via the <code>this</code> reference. However, an lambda cannot have its own instance
      variables, so <code>this</code> always points to the enclosing object.

  <div class="textual-content">
    <div class="sub-heading">What is a Stream</div>
    <div>
      - A stream is a sequence of data elements supporting sequential and parallel <i>aggregate</i> operations.
      <br>
      - So what is an <i>aggregate operation: </i> An aggregate operation computes a single value from a
      collection of values. The result of an aggregate operation may be simply a primitive value, an object, or a
      void. Note that an object may represent a single entity such as a person or a collection of values such as a
      list, a set, a map, etc. <br>
      - Computing the sum of all elements in a stream of integers, mapping all names in list to their lengths,
      etc. are examples of aggregate operations on streams. <br>
      - So what is the difference between a Stream and a Collection: Both are abstractions for a collection of
      data elements. Collections focus on storage of data elements for efficient access whereas streams focus on
      aggregate computations on data elements from a data source that is typically, but not necessarily,
      collections. <br>
      - Following are the points of comparison between Streams and Collections.

      <li><b>Streams have no storage</b>: A collection is an in-memory data structure that stores all its
        elements. All elements must exist in memory before they are added to the collection. A stream has no
        storage; it does not store elements. A stream pulls elements from a data source on-demand and passes
        them to a pipeline of operations for processing.
      </li>

      <li><b>Infinite Streams</b>: A collection stores all its elements in memory, and therefore, it is not
        possible to have an infinite number of elements in a collection. A stream pulls its elements from a data
        source that can be a collection, a function that generates data, an I/O channel, etc. Because a function
        can generate an infinite number of elements and a stream can pull data from it on demand, it is possible
        to have a stream representing a sequence of infinite data elements.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Internal Iteration vs. External Iteration</b>: YOu are normally accustomed to writing for-each loops
        for iterating over a collection. This code has to be written by you - the client. In contrast, streams
        will internally iterate over the collection. This will become clear once you see the example. But,
        streams also provide an
        <code>iterator()</code> method that returns an Iterator to be used for external iteration of its
        elements. You will "never" need to iterate elements of a stream yourself using its iterator.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Imperative vs Functional</b>: The Streams API supports functional programming. Operations on a stream
        produce a result without modifying the data source.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Stream Operations</b>: A Stream supports two types of data operations - Intermediate, Terminal.
        Intermediate operations are known as <i>lazy</i> operations whereas terminal operations are known as <i>eager</i>
        operations. Operations are known as lazy and eager based on the way they pull the data elements from the
        data source. A lazy operation on a stream does not process the elements of the stream until another
        eager operation is called on the stream. <br>
        - Streams connect though a chain of operations forming a stream pipeline. A stream is inherently lazy
        until you call a terminal operation on it. An intermediate operation on a stream produces another
        stream. When you call a terminal operation on a stream, the elements are pulled from the data source and
        pass through the stream pipeline. Each intermediate operation takes elements from an input stream and
        transforms the elements to produce an output stream. The terminal operation takes inputs from a stream
        and produces the result.

        <div class="row">
          <img src="imgs/Streams/StreamPipeline.png" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="StreamPipeline"
               width="350">
        </div>

        - The above figure shows a stream pipeline with a data source, three streams, and three operations. The
        filter and map operations are intermediate operations and the reduce operation is a terminal operation.
        <br>
        - In the figure, the first stream (on the left) pulls data from the data source and becomes the input
        source for the filter operation. The filter operation produces another stream containing data for which
        the filter condition is true. The stream produced by the filter operation becomes the input for the map
        operation. The map operation produces another stream that contains the mapped data. The stream produced
        by the map operation becomes the input for the reduce operation. The reduce operation is a terminal
        operation. It computes and returns the result, and then the processing of stream is over. <br>
        - Stream processing does not start until a terminal operation is called. If you just call intermediate
        operations on a stream, nothing exciting happens, except that they create another stream objects in
        memory, without reading data from the data source. This implies that you must use a terminal operation
        on a stream for it to process the data to produce a result.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Ordered Streams</b>: A data source is said to have an <i>encounter order</i> if the order in which
        the elements are traversed by an iterator is predictable and meaningful. For example, arrays and lists
        always have an encounter order that is from the element at index 0 to the element at the last index.
        Streams based on data sources having an encounter order also have an encounter order for their elements.
        <br>
        - Sometimes a stream operation may impose an encounter order on an otherwise unordered stream. For
        example, a HashSet does not have an encounter order for its elements. However, applying a sort operation
        on a stream based on a HashSet imposes an encounter order so that elements are yielded in sorted order.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Streams Are Not Reusable</b>: Unlike collections, streams are not reusable. If you need to perform a
        computation on the same elements from the same data source again, you must recreate the stream pipeline.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Architecture of the Streams API:</b>
        - All stream interfaces inherit from the <code>BaseStream</code> interface, which inherits from the
        <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface from the java.lang package. In practice, most streams use
        collections as their data source, and collections do not need to be closed. When a stream is based on a
        closeable data source such as a file I/O channel, you may create the instance of the stream using a
        try-with-resources statement to get it closed automatically. <br>
        - The <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface represents a stream of the element type <code>T</code>; for
        example, a Stream&ltPerson&gt represents a stream of Person objects. <br>
        - Note that the <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface takes a type parameter <code>T</code>, which means
        that you can use it only to work with
        the elements of the reference type. If you have to work with a stream of primitive type such as int,
        long, etc. you should use specialized stream interfaces called
        <code>IntStream</code>, <code>LongStream</code>, and <code>DoubleStream</code> to work with primitives
        <div class="row">

      - Basic example using streams

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Creating Streams</div>
    <div>
      <li>
        <b>Streams from Values</b>: The Stream interface contains the following two static <code>of()</code>
        methods to create a sequential Stream from a single value
        and multiple values: <br>
        <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt of(T t)</code> <br>
        <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt of(T... values)</code> <br>
        - The <code>Stream.of()</code> method creates a stream whose elements are of reference type. If you want
        to create a stream of primitive values from an array of primitive type, you need to use the
        <code>Arrays.stream()</code> method. <br>

        <div class="code-block">
          <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
            <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/155a29eca3f80fe7741fa67d5d428206.js"></script>
          </div>
        </div>

        - The Stream interface also supports creating a stream using the builder pattern using the
        <code>Stream.Builder&ltT&gt</code> interface whose instance represents a stream builder. The <code>builder()</code>
        static method of the Stream interface returns a stream builder. <br>
        - This is how you get a Stream Builder:
        <code>Stream.Builder&ltString&gt builder = Stream.builder();</code>
        <br>
        - You can then add elements to the stream by using either <code>add</code> or <code>accept</code>
        methods. Why do you need two methods to add elements to a Stream, you ask? Well because,
        <code>Stream.Builder&ltT&gt</code> interface inherits from the <code>Consumer&ltT&gt</code> interface,
        (meaning, <code>interface Builder&ltT&gt extends Consumer&ltT&gt</code>)
        and therefore it inherits the <code>accept</code> method from the <code>Consumer&ltT&gt</code>
        interface. <br>
        - The <code>add()</code> method returns the reference to the builder that makes it suitable for adding
        multiple elements using method chaining. Once you are done adding elements, call the
        <code>build()</code> method to create the stream. You cannot add elements to the stream after you call
        the <code>build()</code> method; doing so results in an <code>IllegalStateException</code> runtime
        exception.

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Empty Streams</b>: An empty stream is a stream with no elements. The Stream interface contains an
        <code>empty()</code> static method to create an empty sequential stream.

          </div>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Streams from Functions</b>: The Stream interface contains the following two <code>static</code>
        methods to generate an infinite stream:
        <br>
        - <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt iterate(T seed, UnaryOperator&ltT&gt f)</code> <br>
        - <code>&ltT&gt Stream&ltT&gt generate(Supplier&ltT&gt s)</code> <br>
        <br>
        a) Using the <code>Stream.iterate()</code> Method: <br>
        - The <code>iterate()</code> method takes two arguments: a seed and a function. The first argument is a
        seed that is the first element of the stream. The second element is generated by applying the function
        to the first element. The third element is generated by applying the function on the second element and
        so on. <br>
        - Its elements are - seed, f(seed), f(f(seed)), f(f(f(seed))), and so on. <br>

          </div>
        </div>

        b) Using the <code>Stream.generate()</code> Method: <br>
        - The <code>generate(Supplier &ltT&gt s)</code> method uses the specified <code>Supplier</code> to
        generate an
        infinite sequential unordered stream. <br>

        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Streams from Arrays</b>: The <code>Arrays</code> class in the java.util package contains an
        overloaded <code>stream()</code> <code>static</code> method to create sequential streams from arrays.
        You can use it to create an <code>IntStream</code> from an <code>int</code> array, a
        <code>LongStream</code> from a <code>long</code> array, a <code>DoubleStream</code> from a
        <code>double</code> array, and a <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> from an array of the reference type
        <code>T</code>. <br>
        - Recall when we saw in the <code>Stream.of(T... t)</code> method in the first point, we could also pass
        in an array over there as well. So you can create a stream from a reference type array using two
        methods: <code>Arrays.stream(T[] t)</code> and <code>Stream.of(T...t)</code> method.

    <div class="sub-heading">Representing an Optional Value</div>
    <div>
      - An <code>Optional</code> is a wrapper for a non-null value that may or may not contain a non-null value.
      Its <code>isPresent()</code> method returns true if it contains a non-null value, false otherwise. Its
      <code>get()</code> method returns the non-null value if it contains a non-null value, and throws a
      <code>NoSuchElementException</code> otherwise. This implies that when a method returns an
      <code>Optional</code>, you must, as a practice, check if it contains a non-null value before asking it for
      the value. If you use the <code>get()</code> method before making sure it contains a non-null value, you may
      get
      a <code>NoSuchElementException</code> instead of getting a <code>NullPointerException</code>. <br>
      - There are 4 methods to get the value from an optional: <br>
      <li><code>T get()</code></li>
      <li><code>T orElse(T defaultValue)</code></li>
      <li><code>T orElseGet(Supplier&lt? extends T&gt defaultSupplier)</code></li>

    <div class="sub-heading">Debugging a Stream Pipeline</div>
    <div>
      - Sometimes you may need to look at the elements of the streams as they pass through the pipeline. You can
      do so by using the
      <code>peek(Consumer&lt? super T&gt action)</code> method of the <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface that is
      meant only
      for debugging purposes. It produces a stream after applying an action on each input element.
      <div class="code-block">

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Applying the ForEach Operation</div>
    <div>
      - The <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface has two methods to perform the forEach operation: <br>
      <code>void forEach(Consumer&lt? super T&gt action)</code> <br>
      <code>void forEachOrdered(Consumer&lt? super T&gt action)</code> <br>
      - Why the need for 2 methods: <br>
      Sometimes the order in which the action is
      applied for the elements in a stream is important, and sometimes it is not. The <code>forEach()</code>
      method does not guarantee
      the order in which the action for each element in the stream is applied. The <code>forEachOrdered()</code>
      method performs the
      action in the encounter order of elements defined by the stream. Use the <code>forEachOrdered()</code>
      method for a parallel
      stream only when necessary because it may slow down processing.

    <div class="sub-heading">Applying the Map Operation</div>
    <div>
      - A map operation (also known as mapping) applies a function to each element of the input stream to produce
      another stream (also called an output stream or a mapped stream). The number of elements in the input and
      output streams is the same. The operation does not modify the elements of the input stream (at least it is
      not supposed to). <br>

      <div class="row">
        <img src="imgs/Streams/map_operation.png" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="map_operation"
             width="250">
      </div>

      - You can apply the map operation on a stream using one of the following methods of the Stream&ltT&gt
      interface:
      <li><code>&ltR&gt Stream&ltR&gt map(Function&lt? super T,? extends R&gt mapper)</code></li>
      <li><code>DoubleStream mapToDouble(ToDoubleFunction&lt? super T&gt mapper)</code></li>
      <li><code>IntStream mapToInt(ToIntFunction&lt? super T&gt mapper)</code></li>
      <li><code>LongStream mapToLong(ToLongFunction&lt? super T&gt mapper)</code></li>

      - We have already looked at examples of <code>map</code> in the previous examples.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Flattening Streams</div>
    <div>
      -So far we have seen a one-to-one mapping using the <code>map</code> operation where each element of the
      input stream was mapped to one element of the output stream. But in addition to this, the Stream API also
      supports one-to-many mapping. <br>
      - This is basically to create a stream <i>of streams</i>. Think about how you can create a HashMap of
      HashMaps. Similarly, we are creating a Stream, where each "element" is a Stream. <br>
      - Suppose the input stream is a <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> and the
      mapped stream is <code>Stream&ltStream&ltR&gt&gt</code> where <code>T</code> and <code>R</code> may be the
      same or
      different. <br>
      - Then it "flattens" the output stream, which is currently a Stream of Streams, to produce a single Stream.
      So basically it converts a <code>Stream&ltStream&ltR&gt&gt</code> to <code>Stream&ltR&gt</code> <br>

      - Does this make sense now?
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Applying the Reduce Operation</div>
    <div>
      - The reduce operation combines all elements of a stream to produce a single value by applying a combining
      function
      repeatedly. Computing the sum, maximum, average, count, etc. of elements of a stream of integers are
      examples of the reduce operation. Collecting elements of a stream in a List, Set, or Map is also an example
      of the reduce operation. <br>
      - The reduce operation takes two parameters called a <i>seed</i> (also called an <i>initial value</i>) and
      an <i>accumulator</i>. The accumulator is a function.

      <div class="row">
        <img src="imgs/Streams/reduce_operation.png" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="reduce_operation"
             width="320">
      </div>

      - The <code>Stream&ltT&gt</code> interface contains a <code>reduce()</code> method to perform the reduce
      operation. The method has three overloaded versions:
      <li><code>T reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator&ltT&gt accumulator)</code></li>
      <li>
        <code>&ltU&gt U reduce</code>
        <code>(U identity, BiFunction&ltU,? super T,U&gt accumulator, BinaryOperator&ltU&gt combiner)</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>Optional&ltT&gt reduce(BinaryOperator&ltT&gt accumulator)</code>
      </li>

      - JVM: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the virtual machine that runs the Java bytecodes. The JVM doesn't
      understand Java source code; that's why you need to compile your <code>*.java</code> files to obtain
      <code>*.class</code> files that contain the bytecodes understood by the JVM. This compilation is done by
      using the <code>javac</code> command. After compilation, as many <code>.class</code> files will be generated
      as the number of classes in java program (eh.. not really) <br>
      - This is the wrong understanding: "Note that inner classes do not get .class files of their own.
      Instead, they are present in the .class files of their parent classes itself." [This incorrect understanding was because when you look at the file in IntelliJ it shows that,
      both, the outer class and the inner class are in the same file. But, if you go into file explorer in your system and see, you will see that the outer and the inner classes
      are actually in separate files.] <br>
      - The outer class, in this case, is <i>ShadowTest2</i>. This is present in the class file called <i>ShadowTest2.class</i>. The inner class is called <i>FirstLevel2</i>.
      And this is present in the class called <i>ShadowTest2$FirstLevel2.class</i>. This is the format, the parent class name, then the '$' symbol followed by the inner class
      name.

      - The generated .class files are also the entity that
      allows Java to be a "portable language" (write once, run anywhere). Indeed, there are specific
      implementations of the JVM for different systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, see the Wikipedia list), the aim is
      that with the same bytecodes they all give the same results. <br>
      - JRE: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, and other
      components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language. (The point is that, you
      need only the JRE if your sole goal is to only run a Java program.)
      In addition, two key
      deployment technologies are part of the JRE: Java Plug-in, which enables applets to run in popular browsers;
      and Java Web Start, which deploys standalone applications over a network. It is also the foundation for the
      technologies in the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) for enterprise software development and
      deployment. The JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debuggers for developing
      applets and applications. <br>
      - JDK: The JDK is a superset of the JRE, and contains everything that is in the JRE, plus tools such as the
      compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications. <br>

      - It is not necessary that the name of the file should always match the name of the class that is defined
      inside it. If a class is not explicitly defined as <code>public</code>, then the name of the class and the
      name of file within which the class is defined may differ. <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1841847/can-i-compile-a-java-file-with-a-different-name-than-the-class">Source

      <br>
      - Consider the following scenarios: <br>
      a) File name is same as class name. Class is defined <code>public</code>. Everything works as expected.

             width="1000">
      </div>

      b) File name is same as class name. Class is not defined <code>public</code>. Hence the default access is
      applied. Default access in java is <code>package-private</code>. Everything still works as expected.

           width="1000">

      c) File name is different from the class name. Class is not defined <code>public</code>. Note that in this
      case, the <code>class</code> file that is generated has the name as <i>HelloWorldNew</i>. So we run
      <code>java HelloWorldNew</code> in order to run the code in the jvm.

      d) File name is different from the class name. Class is defined <code>public</code>. Note that now the code
      does not even compile. This means that, in order to have the class name different from the file name work,
      you cannot define the class to be <code>public</code>.

      b) implementing two or more methods that have the <i>same name but take arguments of different types</i>
      <br>
      However, do note that it's not possible to have two method implementations that differ only in their return
      types. In this case, the code simply wouldn't compile because of the method call ambiguity - the compiler
      wouldn't know which implementation of multiply() to call.

  <hr>

  <div class="textual-content">

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 153: Static Members</div>
    <div>
      - You can declare the following types of <code>static</code> entities in your code: <br>
      a) Static Variables <br>
      b) Static Methods <br>
      c) Static Nested Class <br>
      d) Static Blocks <br>
      - Remember that from a <code>static</code> method, you can only access other <code>static</code> members. You cannot access instance variables from a method that has
      been declared <code>static</code>. You also cannot use the keywords <code>this</code> and <code>super</code> inside a <code>static</code> method because these keywords
      refer to an instance of the class. Only inner classes can be declared as <code>static class <i>className</i> { }</code>. You can overload static methods but you cannot
      override static methods. <br>
      - <code>static</code> members of a class are created inside something known as method area. JVM memory management was changed in JDK8. No idea what this refers to now.
      Supposedly, this method area is created when the class is first loaded. That is why we can access <code>static</code> members directly from the class without having to
      create an object of the class. <br>
      - If you have a bunch of static methods, then you can group them all together in a <code>static</code> block. <br>
      - <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-static#3-key-points-to-remember-1">Source</a> Key points to remember when using a <code>static</code> variable: <br>
      - static methods in Java are resolved at compile time. Since method overriding is part of Runtime Polymorphism, so static methods can't be overridden <br>
      - abstract methods can't be static <br>
      - static methods cannot use this or super keywords <br>
      - The following combinations of the instance, class methods and variables are valid: <br>
      a) Instance methods can directly access both instance methods and instance variables <br>
      b) Instance methods can also access static variables and static methods directly <br>
      c) static methods can access all static variables and other static methods <br>
      d) static methods cannot access instance variables and instance methods directly; they need some object reference to do so <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 155: Static Blocks</div>
    <div>
      - We can write down a set of statements in a block and declare the block as <code>static</code>. This <code>static</code> block will be executed when the class is
      loaded, i.e. before the creation of any object of the class. <br>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 157: <code>final</code> Members</div>
    <div>
      - The <code>final</code> keyword can be used in various ways: <br>
      a) final variables <br>
      b) final methods <br>
      c) final class <br>
      - There are 3 methods of initialising <code>final</code> variables: <br>
      a) Initialize them when you have declared them <br>
      b) Initialize within a <code>static</code> block <br>
      c) Initialize them inside the constructor of the class. If the class has multiple constructors, then the variable must be initialized withing all of the constructors
      <br>
      - If a method is declared as <code>final</code> then that method cannot be overridden. Similarly, if a class is declared as <code>final</code>, the class cannot be
      extended.

  <div class="textual-content">

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 162: Creating a Package</div>
    <div>
      - <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281\src.zip</code> contains the sourcce files in the case of java versions that are 8 and below.
      <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.10\lib\src.zip</code> contains the source files for java in later versions. <br>
      - Consider the following program. We are creating a <i>Demo.java</i> file that is placed in a package called <i>mypackage</i>. When we compile the .java file using the
      standard <code>javac</code> command, the expectation would be that the file <i>Demo.class</i> is placed within a folder named <i>mypackage</i>. But as we can see, that
      the .class file is placed in the <i>same</i> folder as the .java file. This is what the <i>ls</i> command is showing. Also note that executing the .class file now
      returns an error. No error is produced if we comment out the package name and then compile and re-run the program. <br>
      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18093928/what-does-could-not-find-or-load-main-class-mean">On SO</a>, What does “Could not find or load main class” mean?
      The self answer by Stephen that explains how you launch a program from the CLI using the java command.

      </div>

      - So how do we make sure that the .class file is placed within the right package? For that we have to compile the program with a different command. <br>
      - We use <code>java -d . Demo.java</code> to compile the program. The -d args stands for <i>directory</i>. The <code> . </code> means that the root of the folder of the
      generated class files should be the current folder. <br>
      - The -d args sets the destination directory (or class output directory)
      for class files. If a class is part of a package, then javac puts the class file in a subdirectory that reflects the module name (if appropriate) and package name. The
      directory, and any necessary subdirectories, will be created if they do not already exist.
      If the -d option is not specified, then javac puts each class file in the same directory as the source file from which it was generated.

      - Two things need to be written down: one was how we compile a program from the command line so that the individual .class files actually end up in packages. <br>

      - Second was understanding the difference between the different types of access that are present in java: public, protected, default, private.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 163: Access Modifiers</div>
    <div>
      - There are four levels of access modifiers: public, default, protected, private <br>
      - A class can have three types of members: variables, methods, inner class. An access modifier can be used on any of these types of members. The exception to this rule
      is the outermost class. The outer class can only be either <code>public</code> or <code>default</code>. <br>
      - A class can be used in two ways: either by creating an object of the class, or by extending the class. Both these methods give us a different kind of relationship
      between the two classes.
      <img src="imgs/Udemy_Java/Section17/ClassRelationship.PNG"
           width="688"
           class="center-block img-fluid"
           alt="Example1">
      - <code>default</code> members cannot be accessed outside the package. <code>protected</code> members can be accessed outside the package only if the class that is
      accessing the protected member is a subclass of the class in which the member is defined. <br>
      - Here is an image if it helps clear anything:

    <div>
      - A <code>try</code> block can have multiple <code>catch</code> blocks. But take a note of the hierarchy in which you are catching the exceptions. The subclass should
      be the one that is present higher up and the superclass should be present below. <br>
      - A <code>try-catch</code> block can also have a <code>finally</code> block. The code in the finally block is executed irrespective of whether
      there was an exception during the execution of the program. Even if the program executed properly, the <code>finally</code> block would still be executed. <br>
      - It is not necessary that a <code>try</code> should have a <code>catch</code>. A <code>try</code> can just have a <code>finally</code> and that is still fine. The code
      would still compile. <br>
      - Every developer-defined exception must extend the <code>Exception</code> class. You can override the <code>toString</code> or the <code>getMessage</code> methods of
      the <code>Exception</code> class to create your own custom message that should be displayed on exception.<br>

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 204: enum</div>
    <div>
      - All enums that you declare in your code implicitly inherit from the <a
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Enum.html"><code>Enum</code></a>
      <br>
      - Variables defined in an <code>enum</code> are implicitly <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>final</code>. <br>
      - The <code>ordinal</code> method returns the index of the enum. The index is just the order in which the enums are declared. <br>
      - You can use the <code>values()</code> method to see the values that are present within the enum. <br>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>

      - enums can also have constructors defined within them, but the constructors have to be <code>private</code> or <code>default</code>. They cannot be <code>public</code>
      or <code>protected</code>.

      - You can also add data and behavior to an enum by adding your own constructors and methods to the enum.

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 208: Creating your own annotations</div>
    <div>
      - Any annotation that you create automatically inherits from the <a
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Annotation.html"><code>Annotation</code></a>
      class. Annotations can be applied on the class level, on the method level, with arguments, or on the field level. <br>
      - We create an annotation as follows:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/1fdfa0b31d0a68748c6d6af81af0d406.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - The above annotation does not have any elements that are defined within the annotation. We can add elements to the annotation just like we add abstract methods to
      interfaces. Note that the methods that are added to the annotation cannot throw exceptions or accept arguments. Once the elements have been added to the
      annotations, we have to pass in the values for those elements whenever we are using that.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      - You can also specify a default value for some of the elements. Then you do not have to specify that element when you use the annotation because there is already a
      default value that is present for it.

    <div>
      <p class="inline-heading">What happens if we do not specify the type parameter:</p> <br>
      - Consider the following code:

          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="inline-heading">What happens in case we extend a generic class</p>: <br>
      - Depends on the way that you extend the generic class. Note the below examples.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="inline-heading">How do you use Bounded Types with Generics</p>: <br>
      - You can use the <code>extends</code> keyword to make sure that the type that is going to be used for your class is going to be <i>upper-bounded</i> by some class. For
      example, all classes such as <code>Integer</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Float</code> inherit from the <code>Number</code> class. Hence if we want our class to
      store only <code>Number</code> references, we can use the <code>extends</code> keyword as follows:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 235: Generic Methods</div>
    <div>
      - We can use Generic Types with methods as well. Note that the generic type should come before the return type. <br>
      - Similar to how we could upper-bound types that are accepted in Classes, we can upper-bound types that are accepted as method arguments as well.

      - First we need to define a few concepts: <br>
      a) <p class="inline-heading">Process</p>: unit of executiong that has its own memory space. An instance of JVM itself would run as a process for instance. So when we are
      running a java application, we are in effect kicking off a process. The terms "process" and "application" are used interchangeably. Each application/process that runs gets
      its own memory space, known as the <i>heap</i>. The heap isn't shared between two processes, ie., each process gets its own heap. <br>
      b) <p class="inline-heading">Thread: </p>: single unit of execution within a process. Each process can have multiple threads. In java, every application will have atleast one
      thread which is the <i>main thread</i>. Every thread that is created by a process shares that process's memory space, ie. its heap. Apart from that, each thread's also gets
      its
      own thread stack. This is memory that only that thread will have access to.

      - A <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html">Thread</a></code> is a thread of execution in a program. <br>
      - Each instance of a thread has some state. These are JVM specific states and have nothing to do with the OS thread states. <br>
      - A thread also has a priority that you can assign it from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). <br>

      - In the above example, the main thread does not block just because we created a new thread. It <i>appears</i> to block because the JVM does not terminate immediately after
      the
      main thread completes. This behavior occurs because the JVM waits for all <i>non-daemon threads</i> to complete before it shuts down. By default, threads we create using the
      <code>Thread</code> class are non-daemon threads. These threads prevent the JVM from shutting down, even if the main thread has completed its execution. The JVM shuts down
      only once all non-daemon threads have finished their tasks. This is why it seems like the main thread is "blocked" even after its execution. In reality, it's not the main
      thread that's blocking; it's the JVM waiting for other threads to finish. If we want the JVM to terminate regardless of other threads, we can set a thread as a daemon
      thread by running <code>thread.setDaemon(true)</code>. In this case, as soon as the main thread completes, the JVM terminates, and any running daemon threads are stopped
      abruptly. <br>
      - Note that calling the <code>run()</code> method on the class is not going to start it as a new thread. In order to start computation on a new thread you should call the
      <code>start()</code> method.

      - Each thread has its own stack for local variables and method calls. One thread doesn't have access to another thread's stack. <br>
      - Every concurrent thread additionally has access to the process memory, or the heap. This shared space allows all threads to read and modify the same objects. So when one
      thread changes an object on the heap, that change immediately becomes visible to other threads.

      - In a nutshell, the code below works because the StopWatch class itself does not maintain any <i>shared mutable state</i>. <br>
      - Yes, all the three thread use the same StopWatch instance, but the methods in the instance do not modify any instance variables or rely on mutable shared data during
      execution. The <i>countDown</i> methods perform all their operations locally. The <i>threadName</i>, the <i>unitCount</i>, <i>color</i>, the loop variable <i>i</i> are all
      thread-local, meaning that each thread works on its own copy of the data. A race condition occurs when multiple threads try to modify shared data simultaneously. The only
      shared object is the <i>StopWatch</i> instance, but no state within the <i>StopWatch</i> instance is modified during the method execution. <br>
      - You might expect a race condition if you thought <i>StopWatch</i> maintained a shared state (like a global counter). However, <i>StopWatch</i> is only a wrapper for the
      <i>countDown</i> behavior and does not hold such state. If the StopWatch class had a shared mutable field (e.g., a currentCount variable that all threads updated), then a
      race condition would occur unless proper synchronization mechanisms (like <code>synchronized</code> or <code>Lock</code>) were used. <br>
      - Ofcourse you could always have created 3 different instances of teh <i>StopWatch</i> class to sidestep this.

      - <p class="inline-heading">Atomic</p>: an operation that is performed as a single, indivisible step. This means that it cannot be interrupted or observed in an incomplete
      state by other threads, ensuring its thread-safety. <br>
      - <p class="inline-heading">Memory Consistency Errors</p>: The OS may read from heap variables and make a copy of the value in each thread's own cache. (This cache is
      different from the stack that is allocated to each thread). One thread can modify a shared variable, but this change might not be immediately reflected or visible on the
      heap. Instead, it's first updated in the thread's local cache. <br>
      - Consider the below code example that shows this issue. There are other issues in the code as well, like using the busy-wait loop which is inefficient because it consumes
      cpu cycles unnecessarily while waiting. A better approach would be to use <code>wait/notify</code>, <code>Lock</code>, or <code>CountDownLatch</code>.

      - <p class="inline-heading"><code>volatile</code></p>: ensures that the variable is always read from, adn written to the amin memory, rather than from any thread-specific
