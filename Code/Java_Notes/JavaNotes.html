    <div class="chapter">Chapter 8: Inheritance</div>
    <div class="textual-content">
        - A class that does the inheriting is called the <i>subclass</i> and the class that is inherited is called the
        <i>superclass</i>.
        Therefore, a subclass is a specialized version of the superclass and adds its own unique elements.
        <div class="sub-heading">Inheritance Basics</div>
        - class <i>subclass-name</i> extends <i>superclass-name</i>{
        <br>
        }
        <br>

        <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ba79d9022d2625127daa0f40896e3ceb.js"></script>
        </div>
        - You can only specify one super class for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance
        of multiple superclasses into a single subclass. What you can do is create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a
        subclass becomes a superclass of another subclass.

        <div class="sub-heading">Member Access and Inheritance</div>
        - Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of its
        superclass that have been declared as <code>private</code>. A member declared as <code>private</code> is ONLY
        accessible by other members of its own class. These members are not accessible by any code outside of its class,
        not even by its subclasses.

        <div id="superclass_reference" class="sub-heading">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</div>
        <div>
            A reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is
            important to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that
            it refers to - that determines what members can be accessed.</i> That is when a reference to a subclass
            object is assigned to a superclass reference variable, you will have access to only those parts of the
            object defined by the superclass.
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8d3f3665ec70aced023563b5888d2f20.js"></script>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Understanding super</div>
        <div>
            <code>super</code> has two general forms. The first calls the superclass' constructor. The second is used to
            access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">a) Using super to call superclass constructors</div>
        <div>
            A subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass by use of the following form of
            <code>super</code>:
            <code>super(<i>arg-list</i>)</code>
            <br>
            Here <i>arg-list</i> specifies any arguments needed by the constructor in the superclass.
            <code>super()</code> must also always be the first statement that is executed inside a subclass'
            constructor.
            <br>
            - Since constructors can be overloaded, <code>super()</code> can be called using any form defined by the
            superclass. The constructor executed will be the one that matches the arguments.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7239243bccc65ce54f32df1b7248e120.js"></script>
            </div>
            Notice that <code>super()</code> is passed an object of type <code>BoxWeight</code> - not of type
            <code>Box</code>. This still
            invokes the constructor <code>Box(Box obj)</code>. As mentioned earlier, a superclass variable can be used
            to
            reference any object derived from that class. Thus we are able to pass a <code>BoxWeight</code> object to
            the <code>Box</code> constructor.
            <br>
            - So this is the key concept behind <code>super()</code>: when a subclass calls <code>super()</code>, it is
            calling the
            constructor
            of its immediate superclass. Thus <code>super()</code> always refers to the superclass immediately above the
            calling class.
            Also, <code>super()</code> must always be the first statement executed inside a subclass constructor (that
            is
            IF you are using a <code>super()</code>).
            <br>
            - Remember that if you are calling the constructor of the subclass, and that constructor does not contain a
            <code>super()</code>, the default no-args constructor of the superclass will be called. If the superclass
            does not have the
            default constructor, the code will not compile (recall that default constructor is present in every class,
            but if you are
            creating a constructor of your own then you will also have to create a default constructor).
            <br>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34488484/why-is-super-class-constructor-always-called?lq=1">Why
                is the superclass constructor always called</a>
            <br>
            - The constructors of the parent classes are called, all the way up the class hierarchy through
            <code>Object</code>, before the child class's constructor is called.
            <br>
            -With <code>super()</code>, the superclass no-argument constructor is called.
            With <code>super(parameter-list)</code>, the superclass constructor with a matching parameter list is
            called.
            Note: If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a
            superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the
            superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error.
            <code>Object</code> does have such a constructor, so if <code>Object</code> is the only superclass, there is
            no problem.
            If a subclass constructor invokes a constructor of its superclass, either explicitly or implicitly, you
            might think that there will be a whole chain of constructors called, all the way back to the constructor of
            <code>Object</code>. In fact, this is the case. It is called constructor chaining, and you need to be aware
            of it when there is
            a long line of class descent.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">b) A second use of super</div>
        <div>
            The second form of <code>super</code> acts somewhat like <code>this</code>, except that it always refers to
            the
            superclass of the subclass in which it is used. The usage has the following general form: <code>super.<i>member</i></code>.
            Here
            <i>member</i> can be either a method or instance variable. This second form of <code>super</code> is most
            applicable to situations in which
            member names of a subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b8a1eff34f8ebf8331a78eeaeca6ebe5.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Creating a MultiLevel Hierarchy</div>
        <div>
            You can build hierarchies that contain as many layers of inheritance as you like. Because of inheritance,
            Shipment can make use of the previously defined classes of BoxWeight and Box, adding only the extra
            information that it needs for its own, specific application.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1fb9bc209d80caa7011327b0bf7f17b.js"></script>
            </div>
            This example illustrates an important point - <code>super</code> always refers to the constructor in the
            closest
            superclass. The <code>super()</code> in Shipment calls the constructor in BoxWeight. The
            <code>super()</code> in BoxWeight calls the constructor in Box.
            <br>
            - In a class hierarchy, if a superclass constructor requires arguments, then all subclasses must pass those
            arguments "up the line". This is true whether or not a subclass needs an argument of its own.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">When Constructors are Executed</div>
        <div>
            In a class heirarchy, constructors complete their execution in the order of derivation, from superclass to
            subclass. Further, since <code>super()</code> must be the first statement that is executed in a subclass'
            constructor, this order is the same whether or not <code>super()</code> is used. If <code>super()</code> is
            not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of each superclass will be executed.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/93a913ea7c83ad866875433b6f3b09da.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Method Overriding</div>
        <div>
            In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass, then the
            method in the subclass is said to <i>override</i> the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is
            called from
            within its subclass, it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass. The version
            of the method
            defined by the superclass will be hidden.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0db84861d6a4b08c62815ce370f217df.js"></script>
            </div>
            Remember that method overriding occurs ONLY when the names AND the type signatures are identical. Otherwise
            the two methods are simply overloaded.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Dynamic Method Dispatch</div>
        <div>
            Method Overloading provides the basis for Java's: <i>Dynamic Method Dispatch</i>. Dynamic method dispatch is
            the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than compile time.
            Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how
            Java implements run-time polymorphism. The basis for Dynamic Method Dispatch just that: a superclass
            reference variable can refer to a
            subclass object. Java uses this fact to resolve calls to overridden methods. This is how it is done: when an
            overridden method
            is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method to execute based upon
            the type
            of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is made at runtime.
            When different types
            of objects are referred to, different versions of an overridden method will be called.
            <br>
            - In other words: <i>it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable)
            that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.</i> Therefore, if a superclass
            contains
            a method that is overridden by a subclass, then when different types of objects are referred to through a
            superclass
            reference variable, different versions of the method are executed. Compare this with what we read in
            <a href="#superclass_reference">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</a>" section.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1e79c337d71a4468731f182f443b4cb.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            - Another example that makes more sense is the <code>List</code> interface, and the <code>ArrayList</code>
            and <code>LinkedList</code> classes.
            <br>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14903145/what-is-the-difference-between-list-and-arraylist">What
                is the difference between the following:</a>
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/a237650de27c30321d3324332334b1ea.js"></script>
            </div>
            - There's no difference between list implementations in both of your examples. There's however a difference
            in a way you can further use variable myList in your code.
            When you define your list as in Line 1, you can only call methods and reference members that are defined in
            the List interface.
            When you define your list as in Line 2, you'll be able to invoke ArrayList-specific methods and use
            ArrayList-specific members
            in addition to those whose definitions are inherited from List.

            - Nevertheless, when you call a method of a List interface in the first example, which was implemented in
            ArrayList, the method
            from ArrayList will be called (because the List interface doesn't implement any methods). That's called
            polymorphism. You can read up on it.
            <br>
            - The definition in Line 1 should always be preferred. Why though?
            <br>
            Almost always <code>List</code> is preferred over <code>ArrayList</code> because, for instance,
            <code>List</code> can be
            translated into a <code>LinkedList</code> without
            affecting the rest of the codebase. The only change that we will have to make in the codebase is change the
            Line1 to <code>new LinkedList&ltSomeObject&gt()</code>.
            When you do, in fact, have to use methods that are specific ONLY to <code>ArrayList</code>, you can convert
            <code>List</code>
            to <code>ArrayList</code> very easily.
            Most common error is to accidentally use an ArrayList method, without that being necessary. Changing
            ArrayList to List or another List implementation is difficult.
            Something to note is that "ArrayList specific methods" isn't limited to just methods used in ArrayList, but
            their return types being changed as well.
            <br>
            - Occasionally, the application may require that you use methods in the ArrayList API that are not in the
            List API. For example,
            <code>ensureCapacity(int)</code>, <code>trimToSize()</code> or <code>removeRange(int, int)</code>. That is
            the only sound reason for coding to the class rather than the interface, <a

            <br>
            The above argument also holds for methods that operate on sets or return sets. They should specify
            parameters of type Set:

            Effective Java (Bloch): If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, and fields
            should all be declared using interface types.
            If you get into the habit of using interface types, your program will be much more flexible. It is entirely
            appropriate to refer to an
            object by a class if no appropriate interface exists.

        <div class="sub-heading">Using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods</div>
        <div>
            You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the <code>abstract</code>
            type
            modifier.These
            methods are sometimes referred to as <i>subclasser responsibility</i> because these methods have no
            implementation
            specified in the superclass. Hence, a subclass MUST override them - it cannot simply use the version defined
            in the superclass.
            To declare an abstract method, use this general form:
            <code>abstract <i>type name (parameter-list);</i> </code>
            <br>
            Note the closing semi-colon. No method body is present. Abstract methods CANNOT have a body. Abstract
            classes can have concrete methods along with abstract methods though.
            <br>
            - Any class that contains one or more abstract methods MUST also be declared abstract. There can be no
            objects of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class cannot be instantiated using a <code>new</code>
            operator. Also, you cannot declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods. Any subclass of an
            abstract method must either implement all of the abstract methods or be declared <code>abstract</code>
            itself.
            <br>
            - Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object
            references.
            <br>

        <div>
            The keyword <code>final</code> has 3 uses - the first is in creating a named constant. The other 2 uses of
            <code>final</code> apply to inheritance.
            <div class="sub-heading">a) Using final to prevent Overriding</div>
            <div>
                - To disallow a method from being overridden, specify <code>final</code> as a modifier at the start of
                its
                declaration. Methods declared as <code>final</code> cannot be overridden.
                <br>
                - Methods declared as <code>final</code> can sometimes also provide performance enhancement by <i>inlining</i>
                calls to them.
                Normally, Java resolves calls to methods dynamically at run-time. This is called <i>late-binding</i>.
                However, since <code>final</code> methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved at compile
                time.
                This is called <i>early-binding</i>.

                - Sometimes, you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class
                declaration with <code>final</code>. Declaring a class as <code>final</code> implicitly declares all of
                its methods as <code>final</code> too.
                <br>
                - As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both <code>abstract</code> and
                <code>final</code> (since
                an abstract class is incomplete by itself and relies upon its subclasses to provide complete

            Notice two methods, <code>equals()</code> and <code>toString()</code>.
            <br>
            - The <code>equals()</code> method compares two objects. It returns <code>true</code> if the objects are
            equal,
            and <code>false</code> otherwise. The precise definition of equality can differ depending on the types of
            objects
            being compared.
            <br>
            - The <code>toString()</code> method returns a string that contains a description of the object on which it
            is
            called. Also, this method is automatically called when an object is output using <code>println()</code>.
            Many classes
            override this method. Doing so allows them to tailor a description specifically for the types of objects
            that they create.

                - ArrayList has 3 constructors:
                <br>
                a) <code>ArrayList()</code>: Builds an empty Array List
                <br>
                b) <code>ArrayList(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: Builds an Array List that is initialized with
                the
                elements of the Collection c in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.
                <br>
                c) <code>ArrayList(int capacity)</code>: Builds an array list that has the specified initial capacity.
                The
                capacity is the size of the
                underlying array that is used to store the elements. The capacity grows automatically as elements are
                added to the array list.
                <br>
                You can increase the capacity of an ArrayList object manually by calling <code>ensureCapacity()</code>

                <code>ensureCapacity</code> doesn't change the logical size of an ArrayList - it changes the <code>capacity</code>,
                which is the size the list can reach
                before it next needs to copy values. You need to be very aware of the difference between a logical size
                (i.e. all the
                values in the range [0, size) are accessible, and adding a new element will add it at index size) and
                the capacity
                which is more of an implementation detail really - it's the size of the backing array used for storage.
                <br>
                Calling <code>ensureCapacity</code> should only ever make any difference in terms of performance (by
                avoiding
                excessive copying) -
                it doesn't affect the logical model of what's in the list, if you see what I mean.

                The Linked List has 2 constructors:
                <br>
                a) <code>LinkedList()</code>: The first constructor builds an empty linked list.
                <br>
                b) <code>LinkedList(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: The second constructor builds a linked list

            <div class="textual-content">
                From memory standpoint:
                <br>
                - Individual elements stored in a LinkedList takes more space than an ArrayList as LinkedList also needs
                to store the node information.
                To be clear, even in the worst case, ArrayList is 4x smaller than a LinkedList with the same elements.
                In short, it's basically impossible
                to make LinkedList win the memory comparison, and if you care about space, then calling
                <code>trimToSize()</code> on the ArrayList will instantly
                make ArrayList win again by a huge margin. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11564453/8742428">Seriously.
                ArrayList wins.</a>
                <br>
                - For a linked list, each node occupies AT LEAST 3 times the number of entries, because each node has a
                next and prev reference as well as the entry reference.
                (And in fact, it is more than 3 times, because of the space used by the nodes' object headers and
                padding. Depending on the JVM and pointer size,
                it can be as much as 6 times.) The only situation where a linked list will use less space than an array
                list is if
                you badly over-estimate the array list's initial capacity. (And for very small lists ...).
                When you think about it, the only real advantage linked lists have over array lists is when you are
                inserting and removing elements.
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11564490/8742428">Even then, it depends on how you do it.</a>
                <br>

                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41929556/is-memory-contiguous-allocated-for-arraylist/41929837#41929837">memory

                ArrayList stores "references" or "pointers" to actual storage in an internal object array elementData.
                This array of references may well be contiguous,
                but is JVM specific. The actual objects being added are stored on the heap, and almost certainly won't
                be contiguous, although this is JVM specific.
                <br>
                From Speed Standpoint:
                <br>
                - Prefer ArrayList if you want O(1) random access. LinkedList gives O(1) <code>Iterator.remove</code>
                time.
                This is different from plain old <code>remove(int index)</code>
                which still takes O(n) time for LinkedLists in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/322742/8742428">worst-case

            <code>HashSet</code> extends <code>AbstractSet</code> and implements the <code>Set</code> interface. It
            creates a collection
            that uses a hash table for storage.
            <code>HashSet</code> is a generic class that has this declaration: <code>class HashSet&ltE&gt</code>.
            <br>
            - This class implements the <code>Set</code> interface, backed by a hash table (actually a
            <code>HashMap</code>
            instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set;
            in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. This class permits the
            null element.
            This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>,
            <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
            assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly
            among the buckets.
            <br>
            - Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of the HashSet instance's size (the number
            of elements) plus the "capacity" of the backing
            <code>HashMap</code> instance (the number of buckets). Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
            capacity
            too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.
            <br>
            The following constructors are defined:
            <br>
            a) <code>HashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has default initial
            capacity
            (16) and load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            b) <code>HashSet(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: Initializes the hash set by using the elements of c.
            <br>
            c) <code>HashSet(int capacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has the
            specified
            initial capacity and default load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            d) <code>HashSet(int capacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap
            instance
            has the specified initial capacity and the specified load factor (also called fillRatio)

        <div class="sub-heading"> 4) The LinkedHashSet Class</div>
        <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
            <a href="#collections-framework-api-uml">UML Diagram</a>
            <br>
            The <code>LinkedHashSet</code> class extends <code>HashSet</code> and adds no members of its own. It is a
            generic class
            that has this declaration:
            <code>class LinkedHashSet&ltE&gt</code>. Here, <code>E</code> specifies the type of objects that the set
            will hold. Its
            constructors parallel those in HashSet. Hash table and
            linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order. This implementation
            differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked
            list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is the order
            in which elements were inserted into the set (insertion-order).
            Note that insertion order is not affected if an element is re-inserted into the set.
            <br>
            (//TODO: But this should again run into the same problem that happens when we compare Linked List vs Array
            List. Linked Lists take way more memory. So I think LinkedHashSet should also end up taking an enormous
            chunk of memory )
            <br>
            Like HashSet, it provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>,
            <code>remove</code>,
            <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
            assuming the hash function disperses elements properly
            among the buckets.
            <br>
            - Performance is likely to be just slightly below that of HashSet, due to the added expense
            of maintaining the linked list, with one exception:
            Iteration over a LinkedHashSet requires time proportional to the <code>size</code> of the set, regardless of
            its
            <code>capacity</code>. Iteration over a HashSet is
            likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its capacity. This implementation spares its
            clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic
            ordering provided by HashSet, without incurring the increased cost associated with <code>TreeSet</code>.
            <br>
            Linked Hash Set has 4 Constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>LinkedHashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the default initial capacity
            (16) and load
            factor (0.75).
            <br>
            b) <code>LinkedHashSet​(int initialCapacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the
            specified initial capacity and the default load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            c) <code>LinkedHashSet​(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash
            set with the
            specified initial capacity and load factor.
            <br>
            d) <code>LinkedHashSet​(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: Constructs a new linked hash set with the
            same elements as
            the specified collection.

            A <code>NavigableSet</code> implementation based on a <code>TreeMap</code>. The elements are ordered using
            their natural
            ordering, or by a <code>Comparator</code> provided at
            set creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed
            <i>log(n)</i> time cost for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code> and
            <code>contains</code>).
            Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent
            with equals</i> if it is to correctly implement
            the <i>Set</i> interface. (See <code>Comparable</code> or <code>Comparator</code> for a precise definition
            of consistent
            with equals.) This is so because the <code>Set</code>
            interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a <code>TreeSet</code> instance performs all
            element
            comparisons using its <code>compareTo</code> (or <code>compare</code>) method,
            so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the set, equal. The
            behavior of a set is well-defined even if its ordering is
            inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Set interface.
            <br>
            <code>TreeSet</code> has the following Constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>TreeSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted in ascending order according to the
            natural ordering
            of its elements.
            <br>
            b) <code>TreeSet​(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: Constructs a new tree set containing the elements
            in the
            specified collection, sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements.
            <br>
            c) <code>TreeSet​(Comparator&lt? super E&gt comparator)</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted
            according to the
            specified comparator.
            <br>
            d) <code>TreeSet​(SortedSet&ltE&gt s)</code>: Constructs a new tree set containing the same elements and
            using the same
            ordering as the specified sorted set.

            - Iterators allow you to cycle through the elements in a collection. <code>iterator</code> allows you to
            cycle through a collection, obtaining and removing elements. <code>ListIterator</code> extends <code>Iterator</code>
            to
            allow bi-directional traversal of a list, and the modification of elements.
            <br>
            - The <code>Iterator</code> and the <code>ListIterator</code> are generic interfaces:
            <br>
            <code>interface Iterator &ltE&gt</code>
            <br>
            <code>interface ListIterator &ltE&gt</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>E</code> specifies the type of object being iterated.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Using an Iterator</div>
        <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
            Before you can access a collection through an iterator, you must obtain one. Each of the collection classes
            provides an
            <code>iterator()</code> method that returns an iterator to the start of the collection. By using this
            iterator
            object, you can access each element
            in the collection, one element at a time. In general, to use an iterator to cycle through the contents of a
            collection, follow these steps:
            <br>
            1.   Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling the collection’s <code>iterator()</code>
            method.
            <br>
            2.   Set up a loop that makes a call to <code>hasNext()</code>. Have the loop iterate as long as <code>hasNext()</code>
            returns true.
            <br>
            3.   Within the loop, obtain each element by calling <code>next()</code>.
            <br>
            For collections that implement List, you can also obtain an iterator by calling <code>listIterator()</code>.
            A list iterator gives you the ability to access the collection in either the forward or backward direction
            and lets you modify an element.
            Otherwise, <code>ListIterator</code> is used just like <code>Iterator</code>.

            - A <i>map</i> is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or <i>key/value</i> pairs.
            Given a key, you can find its value.
            Both keys and values are objects. The keys must be unique, but the values may be duplicated. Some maps can
            accept a null key and null values, others cannot.
            <br>
            - <code>Map</code> is generic and is declared as shown here: <code>interface Map &ltK, V&gt</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>K</code> specifies the types of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the types of values.
            <br>
            - There is one key point about maps that is important to mention at the outset: they don’t implement the
            <code>Iterable</code>
            interface.
            This means that you cannot cycle through a map using a for-each style for loop. Furthermore, you can’t
            obtain an iterator to a map.
            However, you can obtain a collection-view of a map, which does allow the use of either the for loop or an
            iterator.
            <br>
            - The Map interface provides three <i>collection</i> views:
            <br>
            a) <code>Set&ltMap.Entry&ltK,V&gt&gt entrySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the mappings
            contained in this
            map. The
            set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is
            modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove()
            operation,
            or through the setValue() operation on a map entry
            returned by the iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
            which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll,
            retainAll and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.
            <br>
            b) <code>Set&ltK&gt keySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the keys contained in this map.
            <br>
            c) <code>Collection&ltV&gt values()</code>: Returns a <code>Collection</code> view of the values contained
            in this map.
            <br>
            What's up with the 3 different return types?
            <br>
            - The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views
            return their elements.
            Some map implementations, like the <code>TreeMap</code> class, make specific guarantees as to their order;
            others,
            like the <code>HashMap</code> class, do not.
            <br>
            - Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys. The behavior of a map is not
            specified if the value of an object is
            changed in a manner that affects <code>equals</code> comparisons while the object is a key in the map. A
            special
            case of this prohibition is that it is
            not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is permissible for a map to contain itself as
            a value, extreme caution is advised:
            the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods are no longer well defined on such a map.
            <br>
            - To put a value into a map, use <code>put​(K key, V value)</code> specifying the key and the value.
            <code>get​(Object key)</code> returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map
            contains
            no mapping for the key.

        <div class="sub-heading">The SortedMap Interface</div>
        <div class="main-content-after-subheading">

            <br>
            - The <code>SortedMap</code> interface extends <code>Map</code>. It ensures that entries are maintained in
            the ascending
            order according to their keys.
            - The map is ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a <code>Comparator</code>
            typically
            provided at sorted map creation time.
            This order is reflected when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
            <code>entrySet()</code>, <code>keySet()</code> and <code>values()</code> methods).
            (This interface is the map analogue of SortedSet.)
            <br>
            - <code>SortedMap</code> is generic and is declared here: <code>interface SortedMap&ltK, V&gt</code>. Here
            <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            - All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface (or be accepted
            by the
            specified comparator).
            Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable: <i>k1.compareTo(k2)</i> (or <i>comparator.compare(k1,
            k2)</i>) must not throw a
            <i>ClassCastException</i> for any keys k1 and k2 in the sorted map.
            <br>
            - Sorted maps allow very efficient manipulations of submaps (in other words, subsets of a map). To obtain a
            submap, use
            <code>headMap()</code>, <code>tailMap()</code>, or <code>subMap()</code>. The submap returned by these
            methods is backed by
            the invoking map.
            Changing one changes the other. To get the first key in the set, call <code>firstKey()</code>. To get the
            last
            key, use <code>lastKey()</code>.

            The NavigableMap interface extends <code>SortedMap</code> and declares the behavior of a map that supports
            the
            retrieval of entries based on the closest match to a given key or keys.

            - The <code>Map.Entry</code> interface enables you to work with a map entry. For example, recall that the
            <code>entrySet()</code>
            method declared by the <code>Map</code> interface returns a <code>Set</code> containing the map entries.
            Each of these
            set elements is a <code>Map.Entry</code> object.
            <br>
            - <code>Map.Entry</code> is generic and is declared like this: <code>interface Map.Entry&ltK, V&gt</code>.
            Here <code>K</code>
            specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of Values.
            <br>
            - Map.Entry is a key and its value combined into one class. This allows you to iterate over <code>Map.entrySet()</code>
            instead of having to iterate over <code>Map.keySet()</code>, then getting the value for each key.

            The <code>HashMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>Map</code>
            interface. It uses a hash table to store the map. This allows the execution time of <code>get()</code> and
            <code>put()</code> to remain constant even for large sets. Remember that the <code>put()</code> method
            automatically replaces any preexisting value that is associated with the specified key with the new value.
            <code>HashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
            <br>
            <code>class HashMap&ltK, V&gt</code>. Here <code>K</code> specifies the type of the key, and <code>V</code>specifies
            the type of the Value.
            <br>
            The following Constructors are defined:
            <br>
            a) <code>HashMap</code>: Constructs a default Hash Map
            <br>
            b) <code>HashMap(Map &lt? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes the Hash Map by using the
            elements of m
            <br>
            c) <code>HashMpa(int capacity)</code>: Initializes the capacity of the Hash map to <i>capacity</i>.
            <br>
            d) <code>HashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: Initializes both the <i>capacity</i> and the <i>fillRatio</i>
            by using the arguments.

            The <code>TreeMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>NavigableMap</code>
            interface. It creates maps stored in a tree structure. A <code>TreeMap</code> provides an efficient means of
            storing
            key/value pairs in sorted order and allows rapid retrieval. You should note that, unlike a hash map, a tree
            map guarantees that its elements will be sorted in ascending key order. <code>TreeMap</code> is a generic
            class that has
            this declaration: <code>class TreeMap&ltK, V&gt</code> Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and
            <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            The <code>TreeMap</code> constructors are:
            <br>
            a) <code>TreeMap</code>: Constructs an empty tree map that will be sorted by using the natural order of its
            keys.
            <br>
            b) <code>TreeMap(Comparator &lt? super K&gt comp)</code>: Constructs an empty tree-based map that will be
            sorted by using the
            <code>Comparator</code> comp.
            <br>
            c) <code>TreeMap(Map &lt? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries from
            m, which will be sorted by using the natural order of the keys.
            <br>
            d) <code>TreeMap(SortedMap &ltK, ? extends V &gt sm)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries from
            <i>sm</i>, which will be sorted in the same order as <i>sm</i>.
            <br>
            Notice that <code>TreeMap</code> sorts the keys. However, in this case, they are sorted by first name
            instead of last name. You can alter this behavior by specifying a comparator when the map is created.

            <code>LinkedHashMap</code> extends <code>HashMap</code>. It maintains a linked list of the entries in the
            map, in the order in which they were inserted. This allows insertion-order iteration over the map. That is,
            when iterating through a collection-view of a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, the elements will be returned in
            the order in
            which they were inserted. You can also create a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> that returns its elements in the
            order in
            which they were last accessed.
            <br>
            <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
            <code>class LinkedHashMap&ltK,V&gt</code>.
            Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            LinkedHashMap defines the following constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>LinkedHashMap()</code>: Constructs a default Linked Hash Map
            <br>
            b) <code>LinkedHashMap(Map&lt? extends K, ? extends V&gt m)</code>: initializes the LinkedHashMap with the
            elements from <i>m</i>.
            <br>
            c) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity)</code>: initializes the capacity.
            <br>
            d) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: initializes both capacity and fill ratio. The
            meaning of capacity and fill ratio are the same as for HashMap. The default capacity is 16. The default
            ratio is 0.75.
            <br>
            e) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio, boolean Order)</code>: allows you to specify whether
            the elements will be stored in the linked list by insertion order, or by order of last access. If
            <i>Order</i> is
            true, then access order is used. If <i>Order</i> is false, then insertion order is used.
