    <div class="textual-content">
        - A class that does the inheriting is called the <i>subclass</i> and the class that is inherited is called the
        <i>superclass</i>.
        Therefore, a subclass is a specialized version of the superclass and adds its own unique elements.
        <div class="sub-heading">Inheritance Basics</div>
        - class <i>subclass-name</i> extends <i>superclass-name</i>{
        <br>
        }

        </div>
        - You can only specify one super class for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance
        of multiple superclasses into a single subclass. What you can do is create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a
        subclass becomes a superclass of another subclass.

        <div class="sub-heading">Member Access and Inheritance</div>
        - Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of its
        superclass that have been declared as <code>private</code>. A member declared as <code>private</code> is ONLY
        accessible by other members of its own class. These members are not accessible by any code outside of its class,
        not even by its subclasses.

        <div id="superclass_reference" class="sub-heading">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</div>
        <div>
            A reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is
            important to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that
            it refers to - that determines what members can be accessed.</i> That is when a reference to a subclass
            object is assigned to a superclass reference variable, you will have access to only those parts of the
            object defined by the superclass.
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8d3f3665ec70aced023563b5888d2f20.js"></script>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Understanding super</div>
        <div>
            <code>super</code> has two general forms. The first calls the superclass' constructor. The second is used to
            access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">a) Using super to call superclass constructors</div>
        <div>
            A subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass by use of the following form of
            <code>super</code>:
            <code>super(<i>arg-list</i>)</code>
            <br>
            Here <i>arg-list</i> specifies any arguments needed by the constructor in the superclass.
            <code>super()</code> must also always be the first statement that is executed inside a subclass'
            constructor.
            <br>
            - Since constructors can be overloaded, <code>super()</code> can be called using any form defined by the
            superclass. The constructor executed will be the one that matches the arguments.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7239243bccc65ce54f32df1b7248e120.js"></script>
            </div>
            Notice that <code>super()</code> is passed an object of type <code>BoxWeight</code> - not of type
            <code>Box</code>. This still
            invokes the constructor <code>Box(Box obj)</code>. As mentioned earlier, a superclass variable can be used
            to
            reference any object derived from that class. Thus we are able to pass a <code>BoxWeight</code> object to
            the <code>Box</code> constructor.
            <br>
            - So this is the key concept behind <code>super()</code>: when a subclass calls <code>super()</code>, it is
            calling the
            constructor
            of its immediate superclass. Thus <code>super()</code> always refers to the superclass immediately above the
            calling class.
            Also, <code>super()</code> must always be the first statement executed inside a subclass constructor (that
            is
            IF you are using a <code>super()</code>).
            <br>
            - Remember that if you are calling the constructor of the subclass, and that constructor does not contain a
            <code>super()</code>, the default no-args constructor of the superclass will be called. If the superclass
            does not have the
            default constructor, the code will not compile (recall that default constructor is present in every class,
            but if you are
            creating a constructor of your own then you will also have to create a default constructor).
            <br>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34488484/why-is-super-class-constructor-always-called?lq=1">Why
                is the superclass constructor always called</a>
            <br>
            - The constructors of the parent classes are called, all the way up the class hierarchy through
            <code>Object</code>, before the child class's constructor is called.
            <br>
            -With <code>super()</code>, the superclass no-argument constructor is called.
            With <code>super(parameter-list)</code>, the superclass constructor with a matching parameter list is
            called.
            Note: If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a
            superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the
            superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error.
            <code>Object</code> does have such a constructor, so if <code>Object</code> is the only superclass, there is
            no problem.
            If a subclass constructor invokes a constructor of its superclass, either explicitly or implicitly, you
            might think that there will be a whole chain of constructors called, all the way back to the constructor of
            <code>Object</code>. In fact, this is the case. It is called constructor chaining, and you need to be aware
            of it when there is
            a long line of class descent.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">b) A second use of super</div>
        <div>
            The second form of <code>super</code> acts somewhat like <code>this</code>, except that it always refers to
            the
            superclass of the subclass in which it is used. The usage has the following general form: <code>super.<i>member</i></code>.
            Here
            <i>member</i> can be either a method or instance variable. This second form of <code>super</code> is most
            applicable to situations in which
            member names of a subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b8a1eff34f8ebf8331a78eeaeca6ebe5.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Creating a MultiLevel Hierarchy</div>
        <div>
            You can build hierarchies that contain as many layers of inheritance as you like. Because of inheritance,
            Shipment can make use of the previously defined classes of BoxWeight and Box, adding only the extra
            information that it needs for its own, specific application.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1fb9bc209d80caa7011327b0bf7f17b.js"></script>
            </div>
            This example illustrates an important point - <code>super</code> always refers to the constructor in the
            closest
            superclass. The <code>super()</code> in Shipment calls the constructor in BoxWeight. The
            <code>super()</code> in BoxWeight calls the constructor in Box.
            <br>
            - In a class hierarchy, if a superclass constructor requires arguments, then all subclasses must pass those
            arguments "up the line". This is true whether or not a subclass needs an argument of its own.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">When Constructors are Executed</div>
        <div>
            In a class heirarchy, constructors complete their execution in the order of derivation, from superclass to
            subclass. Further, since <code>super()</code> must be the first statement that is executed in a subclass'
            constructor, this order is the same whether or not <code>super()</code> is used. If <code>super()</code> is
            not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of each superclass will be executed.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/93a913ea7c83ad866875433b6f3b09da.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Method Overriding</div>
        <div>
            In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass, then the
            method in the subclass is said to <i>override</i> the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is
            called from
            within its subclass, it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass. The version
            of the method
            defined by the superclass will be hidden.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0db84861d6a4b08c62815ce370f217df.js"></script>
            </div>
            Remember that method overriding occurs ONLY when the names AND the type signatures are identical. Otherwise
            the two methods are simply overloaded.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Dynamic Method Dispatch</div>
        <div>
            Method Overloading provides the basis for Java's: <i>Dynamic Method Dispatch</i>. Dynamic method dispatch is
            the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than compile time.
            Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how
            Java implements run-time polymorphism. The basis for Dynamic Method Dispatch just that: a superclass
            reference variable can refer to a
            subclass object. Java uses this fact to resolve calls to overridden methods. This is how it is done: when an
            overridden method
            is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method to execute based upon
            the type
            of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is made at runtime.
            When different types
            of objects are referred to, different versions of an overridden method will be called.
            <br>
            - In other words: <i>it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable)
            that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.</i> Therefore, if a superclass
            contains
            a method that is overridden by a subclass, then when different types of objects are referred to through a
            superclass
            reference variable, different versions of the method are executed. Compare this with what we read in
            <a href="#superclass_reference">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</a>" section.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1e79c337d71a4468731f182f443b4cb.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            - Another example that makes more sense is the <code>List</code> interface, and the <code>ArrayList</code>
            and <code>LinkedList</code> classes.

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/a237650de27c30321d3324332334b1ea.js"></script>
            </div>
            - There's no difference between list implementations in both of your examples. There's however a difference
            in a way you can further use variable myList in your code.
            When you define your list as in Line 1, you can only call methods and reference members that are defined in
            the List interface.
            When you define your list as in Line 2, you'll be able to invoke ArrayList-specific methods and use
            ArrayList-specific members
            in addition to those whose definitions are inherited from List.
            <br>
            - Nevertheless, when you call a method of a List interface in the first example, which was implemented in
            ArrayList, the method
            from ArrayList will be called (because the List interface doesn't implement any methods). That's called
            polymorphism. You can read up on it.
            <br>
            - The definition in Line 1 should always be preferred. Why though?
            <br>
            Almost always <code>List</code> is preferred over <code>ArrayList</code> because, for instance,
            <code>List</code> can be
            translated into a <code>LinkedList</code> without
            affecting the rest of the codebase. The only change that we will have to make in the codebase is change the
            Line1 to <code>new LinkedList&ltSomeObject&gt()</code>.
            When you do, in fact, have to use methods that are specific ONLY to <code>ArrayList</code>, you can convert
            <code>List</code>
            to <code>ArrayList</code> very easily.
            Most common error is to accidentally use an ArrayList method, without that being necessary. Changing
            ArrayList to List or another List implementation is difficult.
            Something to note is that "ArrayList specific methods" isn't limited to just methods used in ArrayList, but
            their return types being changed as well.
            <br>
            - Occasionally, the application may require that you use methods in the ArrayList API that are not in the
            List API. For example,
            <code>ensureCapacity(int)</code>, <code>trimToSize()</code> or <code>removeRange(int, int)</code>. That is
            the only sound reason for coding to the class rather than the interface, <a

            <br>
            The above argument also holds for methods that operate on sets or return sets. They should specify
            parameters of type Set:

            Effective Java (Bloch): If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, and fields
            should all be declared using interface types.
            If you get into the habit of using interface types, your program will be much more flexible. It is entirely
            appropriate to refer to an
            object by a class if no appropriate interface exists.

        <div class="sub-heading">Using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods</div>
        <div>
            You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the <code>abstract</code>
            type
            modifier.These
            methods are sometimes referred to as <i>subclasser responsibility</i> because these methods have no
            implementation
            specified in the superclass. Hence, a subclass MUST override them - it cannot simply use the version defined
            in the superclass.
            To declare an abstract method, use this general form:
            <code>abstract <i>type name (parameter-list);</i> </code>
            <br>
            Note the closing semi-colon. No method body is present. Abstract methods CANNOT have a body. Abstract
            classes can have concrete methods along with abstract methods though.
            <br>
            - Any class that contains one or more abstract methods MUST also be declared abstract. There can be no
            objects of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class cannot be instantiated using a <code>new</code>
            operator. Also, you cannot declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods. Any subclass of an
            abstract method must either implement all of the abstract methods or be declared <code>abstract</code>
            itself.
            <br>
            - Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object
            references.
            <br>
            - To declare a class abstract:

        <div class="sub-heading">Using final with Inheritance</div>
        <div>
            The keyword <code>final</code> has 3 uses - the first is in creating a named constant. The other 2 uses of
            <code>final</code> apply to inheritance.
            <div class="sub-heading">a) Using final to prevent Overriding</div>
            <div>
                - To disallow a method from being overridden, specify <code>final</code> as a modifier at the start of
                its
                declaration. Methods declared as <code>final</code> cannot be overridden.
                <br>
                - Methods declared as <code>final</code> can sometimes also provide performance enhancement by <i>inlining</i>
                calls to them.
                Normally, Java resolves calls to methods dynamically at run-time. This is called <i>late-binding</i>.
                However, since <code>final</code> methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved at compile
                time.
                This is called <i>early-binding</i>.

            <div class="sub-heading">b) Using final to prevent Inheritance</div>
            <div>
                - Sometimes, you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class
                declaration with <code>final</code>. Declaring a class as <code>final</code> implicitly declares all of
                its methods as <code>final</code> too.
                <br>
                - As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both <code>abstract</code> and
                <code>final</code> (since
                an abstract class is incomplete by itself and relies upon its subclasses to provide complete
                implementations).

            There is one special class, <code>Object</code>, defined by Java. All other Classes are subclasses of

            Notice two methods, <code>equals()</code> and <code>toString()</code>.
            <br>
            - The <code>equals()</code> method compares two objects. It returns <code>true</code> if the objects are
            equal,
            and <code>false</code> otherwise. The precise definition of equality can differ depending on the types of
            objects
            being compared.
            <br>
            - The <code>toString()</code> method returns a string that contains a description of the object on which it
            is
            called. Also, this method is automatically called when an object is output using <code>println()</code>.
            Many classes
            override this method. Doing so allows them to tailor a description specifically for the types of objects
            that they create.

                - ArrayList has 3 constructors:
                <br>
                a) <code>ArrayList()</code>: Builds an empty Array List
                <br>
                b) <code>ArrayList(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: Builds an Array List that is initialized with
                the
                elements of the Collection c in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.
                <br>
                c) <code>ArrayList(int capacity)</code>: Builds an array list that has the specified initial capacity.
                The
                capacity is the size of the
                underlying array that is used to store the elements. The capacity grows automatically as elements are
                added to the array list.
                <br>
                You can increase the capacity of an ArrayList object manually by calling <code>ensureCapacity()</code>
                <br>

                <code>ensureCapacity</code> doesn't change the logical size of an ArrayList - it changes the <code>capacity</code>,
                which is the size the list can reach
                before it next needs to copy values. You need to be very aware of the difference between a logical size
                (i.e. all the
                values in the range [0, size) are accessible, and adding a new element will add it at index size) and
                the capacity
                which is more of an implementation detail really - it's the size of the backing array used for storage.
                <br>
                Calling <code>ensureCapacity</code> should only ever make any difference in terms of performance (by
                avoiding
                excessive copying) -
                it doesn't affect the logical model of what's in the list, if you see what I mean.

                The Linked List has 2 constructors:
                <br>
                a) <code>LinkedList()</code>: The first constructor builds an empty linked list.
                <br>

            <div class="sub-heading">Linked List vs Array List</div>
            <div class="textual-content">
                From memory standpoint:
                <br>
                - Individual elements stored in a LinkedList takes more space than an ArrayList as LinkedList also needs
                to store the node information.
                To be clear, even in the worst case, ArrayList is 4x smaller than a LinkedList with the same elements.
                In short, it's basically impossible
                to make LinkedList win the memory comparison, and if you care about space, then calling
                <code>trimToSize()</code> on the ArrayList will instantly
                make ArrayList win again by a huge margin. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11564453/8742428">Seriously.
                ArrayList wins.</a>
                <br>
                - For a linked list, each node occupies AT LEAST 3 times the number of entries, because each node has a
                next and prev reference as well as the entry reference.
                (And in fact, it is more than 3 times, because of the space used by the nodes' object headers and
                padding. Depending on the JVM and pointer size,
                it can be as much as 6 times.) The only situation where a linked list will use less space than an array
                list is if
                you badly over-estimate the array list's initial capacity. (And for very small lists ...).
                When you think about it, the only real advantage linked lists have over array lists is when you are
                inserting and removing elements.

                ArrayList stores "references" or "pointers" to actual storage in an internal object array elementData.
                This array of references may well be contiguous,
                but is JVM specific. The actual objects being added are stored on the heap, and almost certainly won't

            <code>HashSet</code> extends <code>AbstractSet</code> and implements the <code>Set</code> interface. It
            creates a collection
            that uses a hash table for storage.
            <code>HashSet</code> is a generic class that has this declaration: <code>class HashSet&ltE&gt</code>.
            <br>
            - This class implements the <code>Set</code> interface, backed by a hash table (actually a
            <code>HashMap</code>
            instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set;
            in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. This class permits the
            null element.
            This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>,
            <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
            assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly
            among the buckets.
            <br>
            - Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of the HashSet instance's size (the number
            of elements) plus the "capacity" of the backing
            <code>HashMap</code> instance (the number of buckets). Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
            capacity
            too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.
            <br>
            The following constructors are defined:
            <br>
            a) <code>HashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has default initial
            capacity
            (16) and load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            b) <code>HashSet(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: Initializes the hash set by using the elements of c.
            <br>
            c) <code>HashSet(int capacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has the
            specified
            initial capacity and default load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            d) <code>HashSet(int capacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap
            instance
            has the specified initial capacity and the specified load factor (also called fillRatio)

            The <code>LinkedHashSet</code> class extends <code>HashSet</code> and adds no members of its own. It is a
            generic class
            that has this declaration:
            <code>class LinkedHashSet&ltE&gt</code>. Here, <code>E</code> specifies the type of objects that the set
            will hold. Its
            constructors parallel those in HashSet. Hash table and
            linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order. This implementation
            differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked
            list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is the order
            in which elements were inserted into the set (insertion-order).
            Note that insertion order is not affected if an element is re-inserted into the set.
            <br>
            (//TODO: But this should again run into the same problem that happens when we compare Linked List vs Array
            List. Linked Lists take way more memory. So I think LinkedHashSet should also end up taking an enormous
            chunk of memory )
            <br>
            Like HashSet, it provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (<code>add</code>,
            <code>remove</code>,
            <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code>),
            assuming the hash function disperses elements properly
            among the buckets.
            <br>
            - Performance is likely to be just slightly below that of HashSet, due to the added expense
            of maintaining the linked list, with one exception:
            Iteration over a LinkedHashSet requires time proportional to the <code>size</code> of the set, regardless of
            its
            <code>capacity</code>. Iteration over a HashSet is
            likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its capacity. This implementation spares its
            clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic
            ordering provided by HashSet, without incurring the increased cost associated with <code>TreeSet</code>.
            <br>
            Linked Hash Set has 4 Constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>LinkedHashSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the default initial capacity
            (16) and load
            factor (0.75).
            <br>
            b) <code>LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the
            specified initial capacity and the default load factor (0.75).
            <br>
            c) <code>LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)</code>: Constructs a new, empty linked hash
            set with the
            specified initial capacity and load factor.
            <br>
            d) <code>LinkedHashSet(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</code>: Constructs a new linked hash set with the
            same elements as
            the specified collection.

            A <code>NavigableSet</code> implementation based on a <code>TreeMap</code>. The elements are ordered using
            their natural
            ordering, or by a <code>Comparator</code> provided at
            set creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed
            <i>log(n)</i> time cost for the basic operations (<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code> and
            <code>contains</code>).
            Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent
            with equals</i> if it is to correctly implement
            the <i>Set</i> interface. (See <code>Comparable</code> or <code>Comparator</code> for a precise definition
            of consistent
            with equals.) This is so because the <code>Set</code>
            interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a <code>TreeSet</code> instance performs all
            element
            comparisons using its <code>compareTo</code> (or <code>compare</code>) method,
            so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the set, equal. The
            behavior of a set is well-defined even if its ordering is
            inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Set interface.
            <br>
            <code>TreeSet</code> has the following Constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>TreeSet()</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted in ascending order according to the
            natural ordering
            of its elements.
            <br>
            b) <code>TreeSet(Collection&lt extends E&gt c)</code> : Constructs a new tree set containing the elements
            in the
            specified collection, sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements.
            <br>
            c) <code>TreeSet(Comparator&lt? super E&gt comparator)</code>: Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted
            according to the
            specified comparator.
            <br>
            d) <code>TreeSet(SortedSet&ltE&gt s)</code>: Constructs a new tree set containing the same elements and
            using the same
            ordering as the specified sorted set.

            - Iterators allow you to cycle through the elements in a collection. <code>iterator</code> allows you to
            cycle through a collection, obtaining and removing elements. <code>ListIterator</code> extends <code>Iterator</code>
            to
            allow bi-directional traversal of a list, and the modification of elements.
            <br>
            - The <code>Iterator</code> and the <code>ListIterator</code> are generic interfaces:
            <br>
            <code>interface Iterator &ltE&gt</code>
            <br>
            <code>interface ListIterator &ltE&gt</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>E</code> specifies the type of object being iterated.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Using an Iterator</div>
        <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
            Before you can access a collection through an iterator, you must obtain one. Each of the collection classes
            provides an
            <code>iterator()</code> method that returns an iterator to the start of the collection. By using this
            iterator
            object, you can access each element
            in the collection, one element at a time. In general, to use an iterator to cycle through the contents of a
            collection, follow these steps:
            <br>
            1. Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling the collection's <code>iterator()</code>
            method.
            <br>
            2. Set up a loop that makes a call to <code>hasNext()</code>. Have the loop iterate as long as <code>hasNext()</code>
            returns true.
            <br>
            3. Within the loop, obtain each element by calling <code>next()</code>.
            <br>
            For collections that implement List, you can also obtain an iterator by calling <code>listIterator()</code>.
            A list iterator gives you the ability to access the collection in either the forward or backward direction
            and lets you modify an element.
            Otherwise, <code>ListIterator</code> is used just like <code>Iterator</code>.

            - A <i>map</i> is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or <i>key/value</i> pairs.
            Given a key, you can find its value.
            Both keys and values are objects. The keys must be unique, but the values may be duplicated. Some maps can
            accept a null key and null values, others cannot.
            <br>
            - <code>Map</code> is generic and is declared as shown here: <code>interface Map &ltK, V&gt</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>K</code> specifies the types of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the types of values.
            <br>
            - There is one key point about maps that is important to mention at the outset: they don't implement the
            <code>Iterable</code>
            interface.
            This means that you cannot cycle through a map using a for-each style for loop. Furthermore, you can't
            obtain an iterator to a map.
            However, you can obtain a collection-view of a map, which does allow the use of either the for loop or an
            iterator.
            <br>
            - The Map interface provides three <i>collection</i> views:
            <br>
            a) <code>Set&ltMap.Entry&ltK,V&gt&gt entrySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the mappings
            contained in this
            map. The
            set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is
            modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove()
            operation,
            or through the setValue() operation on a map entry
            returned by the iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
            which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll,
            retainAll and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.
            <br>
            b) <code>Set&ltK&gt keySet()</code>: Returns a <code>Set</code> view of the keys contained in this map.
            <br>
            c) <code>Collection&ltV&gt values()</code>: Returns a <code>Collection</code> view of the values contained
            in this map.
            <br>
            What's up with the 3 different return types?
            <br>
            - The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views
            return their elements.
            Some map implementations, like the <code>TreeMap</code> class, make specific guarantees as to their order;
            others,
            like the <code>HashMap</code> class, do not.
            <br>
            - Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys. The behavior of a map is not
            specified if the value of an object is
            changed in a manner that affects <code>equals</code> comparisons while the object is a key in the map. A
            special
            case of this prohibition is that it is
            not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is permissible for a map to contain itself as
            a value, extreme caution is advised:
            the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods are no longer well defined on such a map.
            <br>
            - To put a value into a map, use <code>put(K key, V value)</code> specifying the key and the value.
            <code>get(Object key)</code> returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map
            contains
            no mapping for the key.

        <div class="sub-heading">The SortedMap Interface</div>
        <div class="main-content-after-subheading">

            <br>
            - The <code>SortedMap</code> interface extends <code>Map</code>. It ensures that entries are maintained in
            the ascending
            order according to their keys.
            - The map is ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a <code>Comparator</code>
            typically
            provided at sorted map creation time.
            This order is reflected when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
            <code>entrySet()</code>, <code>keySet()</code> and <code>values()</code> methods).
            (This interface is the map analogue of SortedSet.)
            <br>
            - <code>SortedMap</code> is generic and is declared here: <code>interface SortedMap&ltK, V&gt</code>. Here
            <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            - All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface (or be accepted
            by the
            specified comparator).
            Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable: <i>k1.compareTo(k2)</i> (or <i>comparator.compare(k1,
            k2)</i>) must not throw a
            <i>ClassCastException</i> for any keys k1 and k2 in the sorted map.
            <br>
            - Sorted maps allow very efficient manipulations of submaps (in other words, subsets of a map). To obtain a
            submap, use
            <code>headMap()</code>, <code>tailMap()</code>, or <code>subMap()</code>. The submap returned by these
            methods is backed by
            the invoking map.
            Changing one changes the other. To get the first key in the set, call <code>firstKey()</code>. To get the
            last
            key, use <code>lastKey()</code>.

            method declared by the <code>Map</code> interface returns a <code>Set</code> containing the map entries.
            Each of these
            set elements is a <code>Map.Entry</code> object.
            <br>
            - <code>Map.Entry</code> is generic and is declared like this: <code>interface Map.Entry&ltK, V&gt</code>.
            Here <code>K</code>
            specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of Values.
            <br>
            - Map.Entry is a key and its value combined into one class. This allows you to iterate over <code>Map.entrySet()</code>
            instead of having to iterate over <code>Map.keySet()</code>, then getting the value for each key.

            <code>AbstractMap</code> is a superclass for all concrete Map implementations. The concrete implementations
            are the following

            The <code>HashMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>Map</code>
            interface. It uses a hash table to store the map. This allows the execution time of <code>get()</code> and
            <code>put()</code> to remain constant even for large sets. Remember that the <code>put()</code> method
            automatically replaces any preexisting value that is associated with the specified key with the new value.
            <code>HashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
            <br>
            <code>class HashMap&ltK, V&gt</code>. Here <code>K</code> specifies the type of the key, and <code>V</code>specifies
            the type of the Value.
            <br>
            The following Constructors are defined:
            <br>
            a) <code>HashMap</code>: Constructs a default Hash Map
            <br>
            b) <code>HashMap(Map &lt? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes the Hash Map by using the
            elements of m
            <br>
            c) <code>HashMpa(int capacity)</code>: Initializes the capacity of the Hash map to <i>capacity</i>.
            <br>
            d) <code>HashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: Initializes both the <i>capacity</i> and the <i>fillRatio</i>
            by using the arguments.

            The <code>TreeMap</code> class extends <code>AbstractMap</code> and implements the <code>NavigableMap</code>
            interface. It creates maps stored in a tree structure. A <code>TreeMap</code> provides an efficient means of
            storing
            key/value pairs in sorted order and allows rapid retrieval. You should note that, unlike a hash map, a tree
            map guarantees that its elements will be sorted in ascending key order. <code>TreeMap</code> is a generic
            class that has
            this declaration: <code>class TreeMap&ltK, V&gt</code> Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and
            <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            The <code>TreeMap</code> constructors are:
            <br>
            a) <code>TreeMap</code>: Constructs an empty tree map that will be sorted by using the natural order of its
            keys.
            <br>
            b) <code>TreeMap(Comparator &lt? super K&gt comp)</code>: Constructs an empty tree-based map that will be
            sorted by using the
            <code>Comparator</code> comp.
            <br>
            c) <code>TreeMap(Map &lt? extends K, ? extends V &gt m)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries from
            m, which will be sorted by using the natural order of the keys.
            <br>
            d) <code>TreeMap(SortedMap &ltK, ? extends V &gt sm)</code>: Initializes a tree map with the entries from
            <i>sm</i>, which will be sorted in the same order as <i>sm</i>.
            <br>
            Notice that <code>TreeMap</code> sorts the keys. However, in this case, they are sorted by first name
            instead of last name. You can alter this behavior by specifying a comparator when the map is created.

            <code>LinkedHashMap</code> extends <code>HashMap</code>. It maintains a linked list of the entries in the
            map, in the order in which they were inserted. This allows insertion-order iteration over the map. That is,
            when iterating through a collection-view of a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, the elements will be returned in
            the order in
            which they were inserted. You can also create a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> that returns its elements in the
            order in
            which they were last accessed.
            <br>
            <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is a generic class that has this declaration:
            <code>class LinkedHashMap&ltK,V&gt</code>.
            Here, <code>K</code> specifies the type of keys, and <code>V</code> specifies the type of values.
            <br>
            LinkedHashMap defines the following constructors:
            <br>
            a) <code>LinkedHashMap()</code>: Constructs a default Linked Hash Map
            <br>
            b) <code>LinkedHashMap(Map&lt? extends K, ? extends V&gt m)</code>: initializes the LinkedHashMap with the
            elements from <i>m</i>.
            <br>
            c) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity)</code>: initializes the capacity.
            <br>
            d) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)</code>: initializes both capacity and fill ratio. The
            meaning of capacity and fill ratio are the same as for HashMap. The default capacity is 16. The default
            ratio is 0.75.
            <br>
            e) <code>LinkedHashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio, boolean Order)</code>: allows you to specify whether
            the elements will be stored in the linked list by insertion order, or by order of last access. If
            <i>Order</i> is
            true, then access order is used. If <i>Order</i> is false, then insertion order is used.

        <div class="sub-heading">What is a Lambda Expression</div>
        <div>
            - A Lambda Expression is an unnamed block of code with a list of formal parameters and a body. An arrow
            <code>-></code> is used to separate the list of the parameters and the <i>body</i> of the lambda expression.
            <br>
            - A Lambda Expression represents an <i>instance</i> of a <i>functional interface</i>. Every expression in
            Java needs to have a type. This is its type. <br>
            - When the abstract method of a functional interface is called, it is the body of the lambda expression that
            is executed. <br>
            - A lambda expression is evaluated to an instance of a functional interface. The body
            of the lambda expression is not executed when the expression is evaluated. <i>The body of the lambda
            expression is
            executed when the method of the functional interface is invoked.</i>
            - Consider the following lambda expression: <code>(String str) -> str.length</code>. What should be the type
            of this Lambda Expression? We cannot say for sure, because it's type can be <i>any </i> interface that takes
            a String as an input and returns an int. The following interface can be the type of this lambda expression:
            <br>
            <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> <br>
            <code>interface StringToIntMapper{</code> <br>
            <code> int strToInt(String s);</code> <br>
            <code>}</code> <br>
            In the above example, whenever the <code>strToInt</code> method of the interface will be called, the lambda
            expression above will be executed.
            <br>
            - The following code snippet shows an example of everything put together:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/4fdf743259dd45ca13ce4b4649b2814f.js"></script>
            </div>
            - Java is a strongly-typed language, which means that the compiler must know the type of all expressions
            used
            in a Java program. a lambda expression by itself does not have a type, and therefore, it cannot be used as a
            standalone
            expression. The type of a lambda expression is always inferred by the compiler by the context in which it is
            used. <br>

            - To jog your memory: <br>
            <li><b>What is functional programming</b>: block of code that accepts values, known as parameters, and the
                block of
                code is executed to compute a result. Order of execution of functions does not matter in Functional
                programming since, unlike object-oriented programming, there is no state of the object that is being
                changed.
            </li>
            <li><b>What is a closure</b>: higher order function (anonymous function that can be treated as a data
                object,
                meaning - it can be stored in a variable and passed around from one context to another.) packaged with
                its defining environment. A closure carries with it the variables in scope when it was defined, and it
                can access those variables even when it is invoked in a context other than the context in which those
                variables were defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What does it mean to <i>capture a variable</i></b>: <a
                    href="https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/core-java-tutorial/java-8-enhancements/java-capturing-lambda.html">A
                lambda expression is said to be capturing </a>if it either access instance variables of it's enclosing
                class
                or local variables (final or effectively final) from it's enclosing scope.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What is the difference between an <i>implicit</i> and an <i>explicit</i> lambda expression</b>:
                Lambda expression that does not declare the types of its parameters is known as an implicit lambda
                expression. A lambda expression that declares the types of its parameters is known as an explicit lambda
                expression. <code>(x, y) -> x + y</code> is an example of an implicit Lambda Expression.
                <code>(int x, int y) -> x + y</code> is explicit.
            </li>

            - These are some things that you can do with the body of the lambda expressions. <br>
            - The body of a lambda expression can be a block statement or a single expression. A block statement is
            enclosed in braces; a single expression is not enclosed in braces.
            <div class="code-snippet">

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Target Typing</div>
        <div>
            - There are two kinds of expressions in Java: <br>
            <li>
                <b>Standalone Expressions</b>: A standalone expression is an expression whose type can be determined by
                the expression without knowing the context of its use. <code>new String("Hello")</code>,
                <code>"Hello"</code>, <code>new ArrayList&ltString&gt()</code>. The types are String, String, and
                ArrayList&ltString&gt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Poly Expressions</b>: A poly expression is an expression that has different types in different
                contexts. All lambda expressions in Java are poly expressions. You must use it in a context to know its
                type. For example, the expression <code>new ArrayList&lt&gt()</code> is a poly expression. <br>
                In this:
                <code>ArrayList&ltLong&gt idList = new ArrayList&lt&gt();</code>, its type is
                <code>ArrayList&ltLong&gt</code>. <br>
                Whereas in <code>ArrayList&ltString&gt nameList = new ArrayList&lt&gt();</code>, its type is <code>ArrayList&ltString&gt</code>
            </li>
            - The compiler infers the type of a lambda expression. The context in which a lambda expression is used
            expects a type, which is called the
            <i>target type</i>. The process of inferring the type of a lambda expression from the context is known as
            <i>target typing</i>.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b810f6efcb074aa197646bacf8ce00ea.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Behavior Parameterization</div>
        <div>
            - Changing the behavior of a method through its parameters is known as behavior parameterization. This is
            also known as passing code as data because you pass code (logic, functionality, or behavior) encapsulated in
            lambda expressions to methods as if it is data. <br>
            <div>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/acc99d55de825af933ecba4c61ae3140.js"></script>
            </div>
            - In the above example, instead of passing the lambda expression directly as a parameter, you could have
            assigned it to a variable of the desired type (<code>AnotherJoiner</code> in this case) and passed that
            variable as an argument instead.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Which contexts can a Lambda Expression be used</div>
        <div>
            - Lambda expressions can be used only in the following contexts:
            <li>
                <i>Assignment Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear to the right-hand side of the assignment
                operator in an assignment statement.
                For example: <code>ReferenceType variable1 = LambdaExpression;</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Method Invocation Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear as an argument to a method or
                constructor call.
                For example: <code>behavParam.testJoiner(LambdaExpression);</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Return Context</i>: A lambda expression may appear in a return statement inside a method, as its
                target type is the declared return type of the method.
                For example: <code>return LambdaExpression;</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Cast Context</i>: A lambda expression may be used if it is preceded by a cast. The type specified in
                the cast is its target type.
                For example: <code>(Joiner) LambdaExpression;</code>
            </li>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Functional Interfaces</div>
        <div>
            - A functional interface is simply an interface that has exactly one abstract method. <br>
            - The following types of methods in an interface do not count for defining a functional interface: <br>
            <li>
                Default Methods: Recall
                <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html">default methods</a>
                were methods added to an interface that were not abstract. That is, a default
                method has an implementation right there in the interface itself.
            </li>

            - There are also several specialized versions of these interfaces for frequently used
            primitive data types. <br>
            - <code>IntFunction&ltR&gt</code>, <code>LongFunction&ltR&gt</code>, and <code>DoubleFunction&ltR&gt</code>
            take an int, a long, and a double as an argument, respectively, and return a value of type R. <br>
            - <code>ToIntFunction&ltT&gt</code>, <code>ToLongFunction&ltT&gt</code>, and
            <code>ToDoubleFunction&ltT&gt</code> take an argument of type T and return an int, a long, and a double,
            respectively. <br>

        <div class="sub-heading">Method References</div>
        <div>
            - A method reference is shorthand to create a lambda expression using an existing method. <br>
            - Using method references makes your lambda expressions more readable and concise; <i>it also lets you use
            the existing methods</i>.
            <br>
            - If a lambda expression contains a body that is an expression using a method call, you can use a method
            reference in place of that lambda expression. <br>
            - The general syntax for a method reference is: <code>&ltQualifier&gt::&ltMethodName&gt</code>. The
            <code>Qualifier</code> depends on the type of the method reference. The <code>MethodName</code> is the name
            of the method. <br>
            - The syntax for method references allows specifying only the method name. You cannot specify the parameter
            types and return type of the method. Recall that a method reference is shorthand for a lambda expression.
            The target type, which is always a functional interface, determines the method's details. If the method is
            an overloaded method, the compiler will choose the most specific method based on the context. <br>
            - A method reference does not call the method when it is declared. The method is called later when the
            method
            of its target type is called.

        <div>
            - Sometimes the body of a lambda expression may be just an object creation expression. <br>
            - The syntax for using a constructor is: <code>ClassName::new</code> or <code>ArrayTypeName::new</code>.
            <br>
            - The <code>ClassName</code> is the name of the class that is to be instantiated. It cannot be the name of
            an abstract class.
            <br>
            - The keyword <code>new</code> refers to the constructor of the class. <br>
            - A class may have multiple constructors. The syntax does not provide a way to refer to a specific
            constructor. The compiler selects a specific constructor based on the context. It looks at the target type
            and the number of arguments in the abstract method of the target type. The constructor whose number of
            arguments matches with the number of arguments in the abstract method of the target type is chosen. <br>

            </div>
            - Arrays in Java do not have constructors. There is a special syntax to use constructor references for
            arrays. Array constructors are treated to have one argument of int type that is the size of the array.

            </div>
            - The syntax for the constructor reference for arrays supports creating an array of multiple dimensions.
            However, you can specify the length for only the first dimension.

        <div class="sub-heading">Lexical Scoping</div>
        <div>
            - A scope is the part of a Java program within which a name can be referred to without using a qualifier.
            Classes and
            methods define their own scope. Scopes may be nested. <br>
            - Even though a lambda expression looks like a method declaration, it does not define a scope of its own. It
            exists in its enclosing scope. This is known as <i>lexical scoping</i> for lambda expressions. For example,
            when a lambda
            expression is used inside a method, the lambda expression exists in the scope of the method. <br>
            - The meanings of the keywords <code>this</code> and <code>super</code> are the same inside the lambda
            expression and its enclosing
            method. Note that this is different from the meanings of these keywords inside a local and anonymous inner
            class in
            which the keyword <code>this</code> refers to the current instance of the local and anonymous inner class,
            not its enclosing class. <br>
            - Lexical scoping of a lambda expression means that variables declared in the lambda expression, including
            its
            parameters, exist in the enclosing scope. Simple names in a scope must be unique. It means that a lambda
            expression
            cannot redefine variables with the same name that already exist in the enclosing scope.

                Link explaining why variables inside a lambda have to be final or effectively final.</a> <br>
            - A lambda expression can access instance and class variables of a class whether they are effectively final
            or not.
            If instance and class variables are not final, they can be modified inside the body of the lambda
            expressions. a lambda
            expression keeps a copy of the local variables used in its body. If the local variables are reference
            variables, a copy of the
            references is kept, not a copy of the objects.

            </div>
            - The semantics of <code>this</code> is actually one of the areas where Java lambdas differ from anonymous
            implementations of interfaces. An anonymous interface implementation can have its own instance variables
            which are referenced via the <code>this</code> reference. However, an lambda cannot have its own instance
            variables, so <code>this</code> always points to the enclosing object.

        <div class="sub-heading">What are the two types of multitasking</div>
        <div>
            - Two types:
            <ul>
                <li><b>process-based</b>:
                    <br>
                    - A process is, in essence, a program that is executing. Thus, process-based
                    multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. For
                    example, process-based multitasking enables you to run the Java compiler at the same time that you
                    are using a text editor or visiting a web site. In process-based multitasking, a program is the
                    smallest unit of code that can be dispatched by the scheduler.
                    <br>
                    - Processes are heavy-weight tasks that require their own separate address space.
                    <br>
                    - Interprocess communication is expensive and limited.
                    <br>
                    - Context switching from one process to another is also costly.
                </li>
                <li><b>thread-based</b>:
                    <br>
                    - It is the smallest unit of dispatchable code. This means that a single program can
                    perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For example, a text editor can print text at the same time
                    as the text is being formatted, so long as the two tasks are being performed by two different
                    threads.
                    <br>
                    - Threads are lighter-weight and require less overhead when compared to process-based multitasking
                    <br>
                    - They share the same address space.
                    <br>
                    - Interthread communication is inexpensive, and context switching from one thread to another is

            - In <i>process</i>-based multitasking, two or more programs can run at the same time. In <i>thread</i>-based
            multitasking, two or more tasks from the <i>same</i> program can run simultaneously.
            - A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program
            is called a <i>thread</i>.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">The Java Thread Model</div>
        <div>
            - Single threaded applications use an approach called <i>event loop with polling</i>. In general, in a
            single-threaded environment, when a thread blocks (that is, suspends execution) because it is waiting for
            some resource, the entire program stops running.
            <br>
            - The benefit of Java's multithreading is that the main loop/polling mechanism is eliminated. When a
            thread blocks in a Java program, only the single thread that is blocked pauses. All other threads continue
            to run.
            <br>
            - Threads exist in several states. A thread can be <i>running</i>. It can be <i>ready to run</i> as soon as
            it gets CPU time. A running thread can be <i>suspended</i>, which temporarily halts its activity. A
            suspended thread can be <i>resumed</i>, allowing it to pick up where it left off. A thread can be
            <i>blocked</i> when waiting for a resource. At any time, a thread can be <i>terminated</i>, which halts its
            execution immediately. Once terminated, a thread cannot be resumed.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Thread Priorities</div>
        <div>
            - Java assigns to each thread a priority. Thread priorities are integers that specify the relative priority
            of one thread to another.
            <br>
            - A thread's priority is used to decide when to switch from one running thread to the next. This is called a
            <i>context switch</i>. <br>
            - Rules for context switch:
            <ul>
                <li>A thread can voluntarily relinquish control. This occurs when explicitly yielding, sleeping, or when
                    blocked. In this scenario, all other threads are examined, and the highest-priority thread that is
                    ready to run is given the CPU.
                </li>
                <li> A thread can be preempted by a higher-priority thread. In this case, a
                    lower-priority thread that does not yield the processor is simply preempted - no matter what it is
                    doing - by a higher-priority thread. Basically, as soon as a higher-priority thread wants to run, it
                    does. This is called <i>preemptive multitasking</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="sub-heading">The Thread Class and the Runnable Interface</div>
        <div>
            - To create a new thread, you program will extend the <code>Thread</code> class or implement the <code>Runnable</code>
            interface.

        <div class="sub-heading">The Main Thread</div>
        <div>
            - <i>main thread</i> is the thread that is executed when when your program begins. The main thread is
            important for two reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>It is the thread from which other "child" threads will be spawned.</li>
                <li>Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown
                    actions.

        <div class="sub-heading">Creating a Thread</div>
        <div>
            - You create a thread by instantiating an object of type <code>Thread</code>. This can be done in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li>You can implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface</li>
                <li>You can extend the <code>Thread</code> class itself</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="implementingRunnable" class="sub-heading">Implementing Runnable</div>
        <div>
            - The <code>Runnable</code> class should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be
            executed by a thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called <code>run</code>. <br>
            - Inside <code>run()</code> you will define the code that constitutes the new thread. After you create a
            class that implements <code>Runnable</code>, you will instantiate an object of type <code>Thread</code> from
            within that class. <br>
            - The <code>Thread</code> class defines many constructors. The one we use here is:
            <code>Thread(Runnable threadObj, String threadName)</code>. Here, <i>threadObj</i> is an instance of a class
            that implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. This defines where the execution of the thread will
            begin. The name of the new thread is specified by <i>threadName</i>. <br>
            - After the new thread is created, it will not start running unless you call its <code>start()</code>
            method. The <code>start()</code> method actually calls the <code>run()</code> method of the class that is
            referenced by <i>threadObj</i>. <br>

            <code>class PrimeRun implements Runnable {</code><br>
            <code> long minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> PrimeRun(long minPrime) {</code><br>
            <code> this.minPrime = minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>
            <code> public void run() {</code><br>
            <code> // compute primes larger than minPrime</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>
            <code>}</code><br>

            The following code would then create a thread and start it running: <br>
            <code>PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);</code><br>
            <code>new Thread(p).start();</code><br>
            <code>//or</code><br>
            <code>Thread t = new Thread(p);</code><br>
            <code>t.start();</code><br>

            - Passing <code>this</code> as the first argument indicates that you want the new thread to call the
            <code>run()</code> method on this object. Inside <code>main()</code>, <code>start()</code> is called, which
            starts the thread of execution beginning at the <code>run()</code> method. This causes the child thread's
            for loop to begin. Next the main thread enters its for loop. Both threads continue running, sharing the CPU
            in single-core systems, until their loops finish.

        <div class="sub-heading">Extending Thread</div>
        <div>
            - The second way to create a thread is to create a new class that extends <code>Thread</code>, and then to
            create an
            instance of that class. The extending class must override the <code>run()</code> method, which is the entry
            point for
            the new thread. As before, a call to <code>start()</code> begins execution of the new thread.
            <br>
            <code>class PrimeThread extends Thread {</code><br>
            <code> long minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> PrimeThread(long minPrime) {</code><br>
            <code> this.minPrime = minPrime;</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>

            <code> public void run() {</code><br>
            <code> // compute primes larger than minPrime</code><br>
            <code> }</code><br>
            <code>}</code><br>

            The following code would then create a thread and start it running: <br>
            <code>PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);</code><br>
            <code>p.start();</code>

            the difference between start() and run()</a>
            <br>
            - Well if you defined the <code>NewThread</code> class as: calling <code>run()</code> is literally
            going to call the <code>run()</code> method, like a
            literal method call. No new thread is going to be created. So in the <a href="#implementingRunnable">example
            above</a>, if you wrote <code>newThread.thread.run()</code> on Line 32, there would be a method call to the
            <code>run()</code> method. The <code>run()</code> method would finish executing. And only after that would
            the execution of the loop in te Main class even start. Only if you use the <code>start()</code> method is a
            new thread created and the code inside the <code>run()</code> method executed.
            <br>
            - Another difference between <code>start()</code> and <code>run()</code> in Java thread is that you can not
            call <code>start()</code> twice. Once started, second <code>start()</code> call will throw <code>IllegalStateException</code>
            in Java while you can call <code>run()</code> method several times since it's just an ordinary method.

            should you use <code>Runnable</code> vs when should you use <code>Thread</code>?</a>.
            <br>
            - Almost always you will be using the <code>MyThread implements Runnable</code> interface to create a
            new thread.
            <br>
            - Classes should be extended only when they are being enhanced or adapted in some way. So, if you will not
            be overriding any of Thread's other methods, it is probably best simply to implement <code>Runnable</code>.
            Also, by implementing Runnable, your thread class does not need to inherit Thread, making it free to inherit
            a
            different class.

            <br>
            - Because sometimes (almost never, but sometimes) you want to be able to change the basic behaviour of
            Thread. That's when you'll need to extend it. You can change it by overriding a method from the Thread
            class, you can't do it by implementing one from Runnable. <br>

        <div class="sub-heading">Creating Multiple Threads</div>
        <div>
            - Your program can spawn as many threads as you need.
            <br>
            - In the below example we are creating multiple threads. In the printout, note where the Main thread is
            exiting. It is not like Main is waiting for the other threads to end.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/f698e9f65e5b5f1ecf05416c93594f8e.js"></script>

        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>isAlive()</code> and <code>join()</code></div>
        <div>
            - Look at the previous example. The main thread finished ealrier than the child threads. Often, you would
            want the main thread to finish last.
            <br>
            - Two ways exist to determine whether a thread has finished or not. First, you can call
            <code>isAlive()</code> on the thread which returns true if the thread is still running.
            <br>
            - But you should prefer the <code>join()</code> method. This method waits until the thread on which it is
            called terminates. It's name comes from the concept of the calling thread waiting until the specified thread
            joins it. <code>join</code> also allows you to specify a maximum amount of time that you want to
            wait for the specified thread to terminate.
            <ul>
                <li><code>void join()</code>: Waits for this thread to die.</li>
                <li><code>void join(long millis)</code>: Waits at most millis milliseconds for this thread to die.</li>
                <li><code>void join(long millis, int nanos)</code>: Waits at most millis milliseconds plus nanos
                    nanoseconds for this thread to die.
                </li>
            </ul>
            - In the below example, remember that the main thread that is calling <code>mt1.join</code> (and others)
            will wait for the <code>mt1</code> to finish. The <code>mt2</code> thread is running in parallel and is not
            affected by the <code>mt1</code> and <code>mt1.join()</code> method calls at all. <a

        <div class="sub-heading">Thread Priorities</div>
        <div>
            - Thread priority is just a hint to OS task scheduler and is dependent on the underlying OS. OS will try to
            allocate more resources to a high priority thread but it does not guarantee it. So if your program is
            dependent on thread priorities than you are in-turn binding your program to underlying OS, which is bad.
            <br>
            - From Java Concurrency in Practice: Avoid the temptation to use thread priorities, since they increase
            platform dependence and can cause liveness problems. Most concurrent applications can use the default
            priority for all threads. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20333255/8742428">Link to post on SO</a>

        <div class="sub-heading">Synchronization</div>
        <div>
            - When two or more threads need access to a shared resource, they need some way to ensure that the resource
            will be used by only one thread at a time. The process by which this is achieved is called synchronization.
            <br>
            - Key to synchronization is the concept of the monitor. A monitor is an object that is used as a mutually
            exclusive lock. Only one thread can own a monitor at a given time. When a thread acquires a lock, it is said
            to have entered the monitor. All other threads attempting to enter the locked monitor will be suspended
            until the first thread exits the monitor. These other threads are said to be waiting for the monitor. A
            thread that owns a monitor can reenter the same monitor if it so desires.
            <br>
            - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9848796/8742428">SO Link explaining what a monitor actually is</a>
            <br>
            - This is what happens when your code is NOT synchronized.
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/9a6fdb4fb951d6f65f123cd7141945b2.js"></script>
            - By calling <code>sleep()</code>, the <code>call()</code> method allows execution to switch to another
            thread. This results in the
            mixed-up output of the three message strings. In this program, nothing exists to stop all three threads from
            calling the same method, on the same object, at the same time. This is known as a race condition, because
            the three threads are racing each other to complete the method.
            <br>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>synchronized</code> methods</div>
        <div>
            - To prevent the above, you need to <i>serialize</i> the access to the <i>method</i> <code>call()</code>.
            That is, you must restrict its access to only one thread at a time. To do this, you simply need to precede
            <code>call()</code>'s definition with the keyword <code>synchronized</code>.
            <br>
            <code>class CallMe{</code>
            <br>
            <code> synchronized void callMe(){...}</code>
            <br>
            <code>}</code>
            <br>
            - This prevents other threads from entering the method <code>call()</code> when another thread is already
            using it. And after we make this change, we get the correct output:
            <br>
            [Hello]
            <br>
            [World]
            <br>
            [Synchronized]
            <br>
            Example of using the synchronized statement:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ab92d8351023dd755f7afb0668ab2192.js"></script>
            </div>
            Well we would have expected "Hello Synchronized World". But threads gonna thread I guess.
            <br>
            Any time that you have a method, or group of methods, that manipulates the internal state of an object in a
            multithreaded situation, you should use the <code>synchronized</code> keyword to guard the state from race
            conditions.
            Remember, once a thread enters any synchronized method on an instance, no other thread can enter any other
            synchronized method on the same instance. However, nonsynchronized methods on that instance will continue to
            be callable.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Using <code>synchronized</code> Statements</div>
        <div>
            - Creating <code>synchronized</code> methods within classes might not always work.
            <br>
            - Imagine that you want to synchronize access to objects of a class that was not designed for multithreaded
            access. That is, the class does not use synchronized methods. Further, this class was not created by you,
            but by a third party, and you do not have access to the source code. Thus, you can't add synchronized to the
            appropriate methods within the class. How can access to an object of this class be synchronized?
            <br>
            - You put calls to the methods defined by the class inside a <code>synchronized</code> block.
            <br>
            - This is the general form of the <code>synchronized</code> statement:
            <br>
            <code>synchronized(objRef){</code>
            <br>
            <code> //Statements to be synchronized</code>
            <br>
            <code>}</code>
            <br>
            Here <code>objRef</code> is the reference to the object being synchronized. A synchronized block ensures
            that a call to a method that is a member of <code>objRef</code>'s class occurs only after the current thread
            has successfully entered <code>objRef</code>'s monitor.
            <br>
            - The previous example can then be rewritten in the following manner:

            - //TODO: Read up on what Polling is
            <br>
            - In Java , you have <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, and <code>notifyAll()</code> methods. These
            methods are implemented as <code>final</code> methods in <code>Object</code>, so all classes have them. All
            3 methods can be called only from within a <code>synchronized</code> context.
            <ul>
                <li><code>notify()</code>:
                    <br>
                    - Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If any
                    threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary
                    and occurs at the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's monitor by calling
                    one of the wait methods.
                    <br>
                    - The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on
                    this object. The awakened thread will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
                    be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the awakened thread enjoys no
                    reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object.
                    <br>
                    - This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. A thread
                    becomes the owner of the object's monitor in one of three ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.</li>
                        <li>By executing the body of a synchronized statement that synchronizes on the object.</li>
                        <li>For objects of type Class, by executing a synchronized static method of that class.</li>
                    </ul>
                    - Only one thread at a time can own an object's monitor.
                </li>
                <li><code>notifyAll</code>:
                    <br>
                    - Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. A thread
                    waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the wait methods.
                    The awakened threads will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on
                    this object. The awakened threads will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
                    be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the awakened threads enjoy no
                    reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object.
                    <br>
                    - This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. See the
                    notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>wait()</code>:
                    <br>
                    - Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method or the
                    notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed.
                    The current thread must own this object's monitor.
                    <br>
                    - This method causes the current thread (call it T) to place itself in the wait set for this object
                    and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread T becomes disabled
                    for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread T happens to be
                            arbitrarily
                            chosen as the thread to be awakened.
                        </li>
                        <li>Some other thread invokes the notifyAll method for this object.</li>
                        <li>Some other thread interrupts thread T.</li>
                        <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less. If timeout is zero, however,
                            then real
                            time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    - The thread T is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread
                    scheduling.
                    It then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object;
                    once it has gained control of the object, all its synchronization claims on the object are restored
                    to the status quo ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked.
                    Thread T then returns from the invocation of the wait method. Thus, on return from the wait method,
                    the synchronization state of the object and of thread T is exactly as it was when the wait method
                    was invoked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            - Code without using any kind of inter-thread communication: <br>
            - The problem with this code is that although the <code>put()</code> and <code>get()</code> methods on Q are
            synchronized, nothing is stopping the producer from overrunning the consumer, nor will anything stop the
            consumer from consuming the same queue value twice. Hence you get erroneous output.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/3a6e64c60ef1a99f1eaaed1a3aadc585.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Code after using inter-thread communication: <br>
            - Inside <code>get()</code>, <code>wait()</code> is called. This causes it's execution to suspend until
            Producer notifies you that some data is ready. When this happens execution inside <code>get</code> resumes.
            After the data has been obtained <code>get</code> calls <code>notify</code>. This tells the producer that it
            is ok to put more data in the queue. Inside <code>put()</code>, <code>wait</code> suspends execution until
            Consumer has removed the item from the queue. When the execution resumes, the next item of data is out in
            the queue, and notify is called. This tells the Consumer that it should now remove it.

        <div class="sub-heading">Deadlock</div>
        <div>
            - A special type of error that you need to avoid that relates specifically to multitasking is deadlock,
            which occurs when two threads have a circular dependency on a pair of synchronized objects. For example,
            suppose one thread enters the monitor on object X and another thread enters the monitor on object Y. If the
            thread in X tries to call any synchronized method on Y, it will block as expected. However, if the thread in
            Y, in turn, tries to call any synchronized method on X, the thread waits forever, because to access X, it
            would have to release its own lock on Y so that the first thread could complete.
            - Code showing how Deadlock can be created:
            <br>
            - The next example creates two classes, A and B, with methods foo() and bar(), respectively, which pause
            briefly before trying to call a method in the other class. The main class, named Deadlock, creates an A and
            a B instance, and then calls deadlockStart() to start a second thread that sets up the deadlock condition.
            The foo() and bar() methods use sleep() as a way to force the deadlock condition to occur.

        <div class="sub-heading">Suspending, Resuming, and Stopping Threads</div>
        <div>
            - A thread must be designed so that the <code>run()</code> method periodically checks to determine whether
            that thread should suspend, resume, or stop its own execution.
            <br>
            - Typically, this is accomplished by establishing a flag variable that indicates the execution state of the
            thread. As long as this flag is set to "running," the <code>run()</code> method must continue to let the
            thread execute. If this variable is set to "suspend", the thread must pause. If it is set to "stop", the
            thread must terminate. Of course, a variety of ways exist in which to write such code, but the central theme
            will be the same for all programs.
            <br>
            - Apparently this example was supposed to teach me something:

        <div>
            - It is important to point out the distinction between traditional multithreading and parallel programming.
            <br>
            - In the past, most computers had a single CPU and multithreading was primarily used to take advantage of
            idle time, such as when a program is waiting for user input. Using this approach, one thread can execute
            while another is waiting. In other words, on a single-CPU system, multithreading is used to allow two or
            more tasks to share the CPU. This type of multithreading is typically supported by an object of type Thread
            (as described in Chapter 11). Although this type of multithreading will always remain quite useful, it was
            not optimized for situations in which two or more CPUs are available (multicore computers).
            <br>
            - When multiple CPUs are present, a second type of multithreading capability that supports true parallel
            execution is required. With two or more CPUs, it is possible to execute portions of a program
            simultaneously, with each part executing on its own CPU. This can be used to significantly speed up the
            execution of some types of operations, such as sorting, transforming, or searching a large array. In many
            cases, these types of operations can be broken down into smaller pieces (each acting on a portion of the
            array), and each piece can be run on its own CPU.
