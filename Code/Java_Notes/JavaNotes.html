    <div class="chapter">Chapter 8: Inheritance</div>
    <div class="textual-content">
        - A class that does the inheriting is called the <i>subclass</i> and the class that is inherited is called the
        <i>superclass</i>.
        Therefore, a subclass is a specialized version of the superclass and adds its own unique elements.
        <div class="sub-heading">Inheritance Basics</div>
        - class <i>subclass-name</i> extends <i>superclass-name</i>{
        <br>
        }
        <br>

        <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ba79d9022d2625127daa0f40896e3ceb.js"></script>
        </div>
        <div class="output">
            The output is:
            <br>
            Contents of superObj:
            <br>
            i: 10 j: 20
            <br>
            Contents of subObj:
            <br>
            i: 7 j: 8
            <br>
            k: 9
            <br>
            The sum is:
            <br>
            i + j + k = 24
        </div>
        - You can only specify one super class for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance
        of
        multiple superclasses into a single subclass. What you can do is create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a
        subclass becomes a superclass of
        another subclass.

        <div class="sub-heading">Member Access and Inheritance</div>
        - Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of its
        superclass
        that have been declared as <b>private</b>. A member declared as <b>private</b> is ONLY accessible by other
        members
        of its own class. These members are not accessible by any code outside of its class, not even by its subclasses.

        <div class="sub-heading">A superclass variable can reference a subclass object</div>
        <div>
            A reference of a superclass can be assigned a reference to any subclass derived from that superclass. It is
            important
            to understand that <i>it is the type of the reference variable - not the type of the object that it refers
            to - that determines what
            members can be accessed.</i> That is when a reference to a subclass object is assigned to a superclass
            reference variable, you will
            have access to only those parts of the object defined by the superclass.
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8d3f3665ec70aced023563b5888d2f20.js"></script>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Understanding super</div>
        <div>
            <b>super</b> has two general forms. The first calls the superclass' constructor. The second is used to
            access a member of
            the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">a) Using super to call superclass constructors</div>
        <div>
            A subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass by usat it is the type of ing the following form
            of <b>super</b>:
            super(<i>arg-list</i>)
            <br>
            Here <i>arg-list</i> specifies any arguments needed by the constructor in the superclass. <b>super()</b>
            must also always be the
            first statement that is executed inside a subclass' constructor.
            <br>
            - Since constructors can be overloaded, <b>super()</b> can be called using abd form defined by the
            superclass.
            The constructor executed will be the one that matches the arguments.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7239243bccc65ce54f32df1b7248e120.js"></script>
            </div>
            Notice that <b>super()</b> is passed an object of type <b>BoxWeight</b> - not of type <b>Box</b>. This still
            invokes the constructor <b>Box(Box obj)</b>. As mentioned earlier, a superclass variable can be used to
            reference any object
            derived from that class. Thus we are able to pass a <b>BoxWeight</b> object to the <b>Box</b> constructor.
            <br>
            - So this is the key concept behind <b>super()</b>: when a subclass calls <b>super()</b>, it is calling the
            constructor
            of its immediate superclass. Thus <b>super()</b> always refers to the superclass immediately above the
            calling class.
            Also, <b>super()</b> must always be the first statement executed inside a subclass constructor (that is
            IF you are using a <b>super()</b>).
            <br>
            - Remember that if you are calling the constructor of the subclass, and that constructor does not contain a
            <b>super()</b>,
            the default no-args constructor of the superclass will be called. If the superclass does not have the
            default constructor,
            the code will not compile (recall that default constructor is present in every class, but if you are
            creating a constructor of your
            own then you will also have to create a default constructor).
            <br>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34488484/why-is-super-class-constructor-always-called?lq=1">Why
                is the superclass constructor always called</a>
            <br>
            - The constructors of the parent classes are called, all the way up the class hierarchy through
            <b>Object</b>, before the child class's
            constructor is called.
            <br>
            -With <b>super()</b>, the superclass no-argument constructor is called. With <b>super(parameter list)</b>,
            the superclass
            constructor with a matching parameter list is called. Note: If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a
            superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the
            superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error.
            <b>Object</b> does have such a constructor, so if <b>Object</b> is the only superclass, there is no problem.
            If a subclass constructor invokes a constructor of its superclass, either explicitly or implicitly, you
            might think that there will be a whole chain of constructors called, all the way back to the constructor of
            <b>Object</b>.
            In fact, this is the case. It is called constructor chaining, and you need to be aware of it when there is
            a long line of class descent.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">b) A second use of super</div>
        <div>
            The second form of <b>super</b> acts somewhat like <b>this</b>, except that it always refers to the
            superclass of the subclass
            in which it is used. The usage has the following general form: <b>super.<i>member</i></b>. Here
            <i>member</i> can be either a
            method or instance variable. This second form of <b>super</b> is most applicable to situations in which
            member names of a
            subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b8a1eff34f8ebf8331a78eeaeca6ebe5.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Creating a MultiLevel Hierarchy</div>
        <div>
            You can build hierarchies that contain as many layers of inheritance as you like. Because of inheritance,
            Shipment can make use of the
            previously defined classes of BoxWeight and Box, adding only the extra information that it needs for its
            own, specific application.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d1fb9bc209d80caa7011327b0bf7f17b.js"></script>
            </div>
            This example illustrates an important point - <b>super</b> always refers to the constructor in the closest
            superclass. The
            <b>super()</b> in Shipment calls the constructor in BoxWeight. The <b>super()</b> in BoxWeight calls the
            constructor in Box.
            <br>
            - In a class hierarchy, if a superclass constructor requires arguments, then all subclasses must pass those
            arguments "up the line".
            This is true whether or not a subclass needs an argument of its own.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">When Constructors are Executed</div>
        <div>
            In a class heirarchy, constructors complete their execution in the order of derivation, from superclass to
            subclass. Furthe,
            since <b>super()</b> must be the first statement that is executed in a subclass' contructor, this order is
            the same whether or not
            <b>super()</b> is used. If <b>super()</b> is not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of each
            superclass will be
            executed.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/93a913ea7c83ad866875433b6f3b09da.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Method Overriding</div>
        <div>
            In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass, then the
            method in the
            subclass is said to <i>override</i> the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is called from
            within its subclass,
            it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass. The version of the method
            defined by the superclass
            will be hidden.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0db84861d6a4b08c62815ce370f217df.js"></script>
            </div>
            Remember that method overriding occurs ONLY when the names AND the type signatures are identical. Otherwise
            the two methods
            are simply overloaded.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Dynamic Method Dispatch</div>
        <div>
            Method Overloading provides the basis for Java's: <i>Dynamic Method Dispatch</i>. Dynamic method dispatch is
            the mechanism by which
            a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than compile time. Dynamic method dispatch is
            important because this is how
            Java implements run-time polymorphism. The basis for Dynamic Method Dispatch just that: a superclass
            reference variable can refer to a
            subclass object. Java uses this fact to resolve calls to overridden methods. This is how it is done: when an
            overridden method
            is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method to execute based upon
            the type
            of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is amde at runtime.
            When different types
            of objects are referred to, different versions of an overridden method will be called.
            <br>
            - In other words: <i>it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable)
            that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.</i> Therefore, if a superclass
            contains
            a method that is overridden by a subclass, then when different types of objects are referred to through a
            superclass
            reference variable, different versions of the method are executed. Compare this with what we read in
            "A superclass variable can reference a subclass object" section.

            - There's no difference between list implementations in both of your examples. There's however a difference
            in a way you can further use variable myList in your code.
            When you define your list as in Line 1, you can only call methods and reference members that are defined in
            the List interface.
            When you define your list as in Line 2, you'll be able to invoke ArrayList-specific methods and use
            ArrayList-specific members
            in addition to those whose definitions are inherited from List.
            <br>
            - Nevertheless, when you call a method of a List interface in the first example, which was implemented in
            ArrayList, the method
            from ArrayList will be called (because the List interface doesn't implement any methods). That's called
            polymorphism. You can read up on it.
            <br>
            - The definition in Line 2 should always be preferred. Why though?
            <br>
            Almost always <b>List</b> is preferred over <b>ArrayList</b> because, for instance, <b>List</b> can be
            translated into a <b>LinkedList</b> without
            affecting the rest of the codebase. The only change that we will have to make in the codebase is change the
            Line1 to new LinkedList&ltSomeObject&gt().
            When you do, in fact, have to use methods that are specific ONLY to <b>ArrayList</b>, you can convert <b>List</b>
            to <b>ArrayList</b> very easily.
            Most common error is to accidentally use an ArrayList method, without that being necessary. Changing
            ArrayList to List or another List implementation is difficult.
            Something to note is that "ArrayList specific methods" isn't limited to just methods used in ArrayList, but
            their return types being changed as well.
            <br>
            - Occasionally, the application may require that you use methods in the ArrayList API that are not in the
            List API. For example,
            <b>ensureCapacity(int)</b>, <b>trimToSize()</b> or <b>removeRange(int, int)</b>. That is the only sound
            reason for coding to the class
            rather than the interface, <a

            <br>
            The above argument also holds for methods that operate on sets or return sets. They should specify
            parameters of type Set:

            Effective Java (Bloch): If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, and fields
            should all be declared using interface types.
            If you get into the habit of using interface types, your program will be much more flexible. It is entirely
            appropriate to refer to an
            object by a class if no appropriate interface exists.

        <div class="sub-heading">Using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods</div>
        <div>
            You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the <b>abstract</b> type
            modifier.These
            methods are sometimes referred to as <i>subclasser responsibility</i> because these methods have no
            implementation
            specified in the superclass. Hence, a subclass MUST override them - it cannot simply use the version defined
            in the superclass.
            To declare an abstract method, use this general form:
            <b>abstract <i>type name (parameter-list);</i> </b>
            <br>
            Note the closing semi-colon. No method body is present. Abstract methods CANNOT have a body. Abstract
            classes can have
            concrete methods along with abstract methods though.
            <br>
            - Any class that contains one or more abstract methods MUST also be declared abstract. There can be no
            objects of an
            abstract class. That is, an abstract class cannot be instantiated using a <b>new</b> operator. Also, you
            cannot
            declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods. Any subclass of an abstract method must either
            implement
            all of the abstract methods or be declared <b>abstract</b> itself.
            <br>
            - Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object
            references.
            <br>
            - To declare a class abstract:

        <div>
            The keyword <b>final</b> has 3 uses - the first is in creating a named constant. The other 2 uses of <b>final</b>
            apply to
            inheritance.
            <div class="sub-heading">a) Using final to prevent Overriding</div>
            <div>
                - To disallow a method from being overridden, specify <b>final</b> as a modifier at the start of its
                declaration.
                Methods declared as <b>final</b> cannot be overridden.
                <br>
                - Methods declared as <b>final</b> can sometimes also provide performance enhancement by <i>inlining</i>
                calls to them.
                Normally, Java resolves calls to methods dynamically aat run-time. This is called <i>late-binding</i>.
                However, since <b>final</b> methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved at compile time.
                This is
                called <i>early-binding</i>.

            <div>
                - Sometimes, you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class
                declaration
                with <b>final</b>. Declaring a class as <b>final</b> implicitly declares all of ots methods as
                <b>final</b>
                too.
                <br>
                - As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both <b>abstract</b> and <b>final</b> (since
                an abstract class
                is incomplete by itself and relies upon its subclasses to provide complete implementations).

            being compared.
            <br>
            - The <b>toString()</b> method returns a string that contains a description of the object on which it is
            called.
            Also, this method is automatically called when an object is output using <b>println()</b>. Many classes
            override this method.
            Doing so allows them to tailor a description specifically for the types of objects that they create.

                ensureCapacity doesn't change the logical size of an ArrayList - it changes the capacity, which is the
                size the list can reach
                before it next needs to copy values. You need to be very aware of the difference between a logical size
                (i.e. all the
                values in the range [0, size) are accessible, and adding a new element will add it at index size) and
                the capacity
                which is more of an implementation detail really - it's the size of the backing array used for storage.
                <br>
                Calling ensureCapacity should only ever make any difference in terms of performance (by avoiding
                excessive copying) -
                it doesn't affect the logical model of what's in the list, if you see what I mean.

                From memory standpoint:
                <br>
                - Individual elements stored in a LinkedList takes more space than an ArrayList as LinkedList also needs
                to store the node information.
                To be clear, even in the worst case, ArrayList is 4x smaller than a LinkedList with the same elements.
                In short, it's basically impossible
                to make LinkedList win the memory comparison, and if you care about space, then calling
                <b>trimToSize()</b> on the ArrayList will instantly
                make ArrayList win again by a huge margin. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11564453/8742428">Seriously.

                <br>
                - For a linked list, each node occupies AT LEAST 3 times the number of entries, because each node has a
                next and prev reference as well as the entry reference.
                (And in fact, it is more than 3 times, because of the space used by the nodes' object headers and
                padding. Depending on the JVM and pointer size,
                it can be as much as 6 times.) The only situation where a linked list will use less space than an array
                list is if
                you badly over-estimate the array list's initial capacity. (And for very small lists ...).
                When you think about it, the only real advantage linked lists have over array lists is when you are
                inserting and removing elements.

                ArrayList stores "references" or "pointers" to actual storage in an internal object array elementData.
                This array of references may well be contiguous,
                but is JVM specific. The actual objects being added are stored on the heap, and almost certainly won't
                be contiguous, although this is JVM specific.

        <div class="main-content-after-subheading">
			<b>HashSet</b> extends <b>AbstractSet</b> and implements the <b>Set</b> interface. It creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage.
			<b>HashSet</b> is a generic class that has this declaration: <b>class HashSet&ltE&gt</b>.

			- This class implements the <b>Set</b> interface, backed by a hash table (actually a <b>HashMap</b> instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set;
			in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. This class permits the null element.
			This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (add, remove, contains and size), assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly
			among the buckets.
			<br>
			- Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of the HashSet instance's size (the number of elements) plus the "capacity" of the backing
			<b>HashMap</b> instance (the number of buckets). Thus, it's very important not to set the initial capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration
			performance is important.
			<br>
			The following constructors are defined:
			<br>
			a) <b>HashSet()</b>: Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).
			<br>
			b) <b>HashSet(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c)</b>: Initializes the hash set by using the elements of c.
			<br>

		<div class="sub-heading"> 4) The LinkedHashSet Class</div>
		<div class="main-content-after-subheading">
			The <b>LinkedHashSet</b> class extends <b>HashSet</b> and adds no members of its own. It is a generic class that has this declaration:
			<b>class LinkedHashSet&ltE&gt</b>. Here, E specifies the type of objects that the set will hold. Its constructors parallel those in HashSet. Hash table and
			linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order. This implementation differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked
			list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is the order in which elements were inserted into the set (insertion-order).
			Note that insertion order is not affected if an element is re-inserted into the set.
			<br>
			Like HashSet, it provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (add, contains and remove), assuming the hash function disperses elements properly
			among the buckets. Performance is likely to be just slightly below that of HashSet, due to the added expense of maintaining the linked list, with one exception:
			Iteration over a LinkedHashSet requires time proportional to the size of the set, regardless of its capacity. Iteration over a HashSet is
			likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its capacity. This implementation spares its clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic
			ordering provided by HashSet, without incurring the increased cost associated with <b>TreeSet</b>.
			<br>
			Linked Hash Set has 4 Constructors:
			<br>
			a) LinkedHashSet​(): Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).
			<br>
			b) LinkedHashSet​(int initialCapacity): Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the specified initial capacity and the default load factor (0.75).
			<br>
			c) LinkedHashSet​(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor): Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the specified initial capacity and load factor.
			<br>
			d) LinkedHashSet​(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c): Constructs a new linked hash set with the same elements as the specified collection.

		<div class="sub-heading"> 5) The TreeSet Class</div>
		<div class="main-content-after-subheading">
			A <b>NavigableSet</b> implementation based on a <b>TreeMap</b>. The elements are ordered using their natural ordering, or by a <b>Comparator</b> provided at
			set creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed 	<i>log(n)</i> time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains).
			Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if it is to correctly implement
			the <i>Set</i> interface. (See <b>Comparable</b> or <b>Comparator</b> for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the <b>Set</b>
			interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a <b>TreeSet</b> instance performs all element comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method,
			so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the set, equal. The behavior of a set is well-defined even if its ordering is
			inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Set interface.
			<br>
			<b>TreeSet</b> has the following Constructors:
			<br>
			a) TreeSet(): Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted in ascending order according to the natural ordering of its elements.
			<br>
			b) TreeSet​(Collection&lt? extends E&gt c): Constructs a new tree set containing the elements in the specified collection, sorted according
			to the natural ordering of its elements.
			<br>
			c) TreeSet​(Comparator&lt? super E&gt comparator): Constructs a new, empty tree set, sorted according to the specified comparator.
			<br>
			d) TreeSet​(SortedSet&ltE&gt s): Constructs a new tree set containing the same elements and using the same ordering as the specified sorted set.

		<div class="sub-heading">Accessing a Collection via an Iterator</div>
		<div class="main-content-after-subheading">
			- Iterators allow you to cycle through the elements in a collection. <b>iterator</b> allows you to
			cycle through a collection, obtaining and removing elements. <b>ListIterator</b> extends <b>Iterator</b> to allow bi-directional traversal of a list,
			and the modification of elements.
			<br>
			- The <b>Iterator</b> and the <b>ListIterator</b> are generic interfaces:
			<br>
			<b>interface Iterator &ltE&gt</b>
			<br>
			<b>interface ListIterator &ltE&gt</b>
			Here <b>E</b> specifies the type of object being iterated.
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">Using an Iterator</div>
		<div class="main-content-after-subheading">
			Before you can access a collection through an iterator, you must obtain one. Each of the collection classes provides an
			<b>iterator()</b> method that returns an iterator to the start of the collection. By using this iterator object, you can access each element
			in the collection, one element at a time. In general, to use an iterator to cycle through the contents of a collection, follow these steps:
			<br>
			1.   Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling the collection’s <b>iterator()</b> method.
			<br>
			2.   Set up a loop that makes a call to <b>hasNext()</b>. Have the loop iterate as long as <b>hasNext()</b> returns true.
			<br>
			3.   Within the loop, obtain each element by calling <b>next()</b>.
			<br>
			For collections that implement List, you can also obtain an iterator by calling <b>listIterator()</b>.
			A list iterator gives you the ability to access the collection in either the forward or backward direction and lets you modify an element.
			Otherwise, <b>ListIterator</b> is used just like <b>Iterator</b>.

		<div class="sub-heading">Working with Maps</div>
		<div class="main-content-after-subheading">
			- A <i>map</i> is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or <i>key/value</i> pairs. Given a key, you can find its value.
			Both keys and values are objects. The keys must be unique, but the values may be duplicated. Some maps can accept a null key and null values, others cannot.
			<br>
			- There is one key point about maps that is important to mention at the outset: they don’t implement the <b>Iterable</b> interface.
			This means that you cannot cycle through a map using a for-each style for loop. Furthermore, you can’t obtain an iterator to a map.
			However, as you will soon see, you can obtain a collection-view of a map, which does allow the use of either the for loop or an iterator.
