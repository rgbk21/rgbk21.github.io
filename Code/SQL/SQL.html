        <div id="Ch1" class="sub-heading">Chapter 1: Data and Tables - A Place for Everything</div>
        <hr>
        <div class="textual-content">
            - If you have a bunch of data that you want ot organize into a table, the first thing that you need to do is
            identify the common bits of data and then assign that common bit a column name.
            <br>
            <div class="sub-heading">What is a Database</div>
            <div>
                - A database is a structure that holds tables and other SQL structures related to those tables. A table
                is the structure inside your database that contains data, organized in columns and rows. Each category
                that you identified earlier becomes a <i>column</i>. All the information about one object in your table
                becomes a <i>row</i>. You will often see the word <i>field</i> used instead of a column. They mean the
                same thing. Also, row and <i>record</i> are used interchangeably.
                <br>
                - Databases contain connected data - meaning - all of the tables in a database should be connected in
                some way.
                <br>
                - The SQL language requires all tables to be inside a database. SO even if you have a single table, you
                need to place it inside a database. One of the features of SQL is to control access to your tables by
                multiple users. Being able to grant or deny access to an entire database is sometime simpler than having
                to control the permissions on each one of the multiple tables.
                <br>
                - SQL does not allow you ot recreate an existing TABLE or DATABASE. If you try to create a new table
                that has the same name as an existing table, it will give you a "Table already exists Exception". (Even
                if the new table taht you are creating is different from the existing table). Hence to create a new
                table that has the same name as an existing table, you will have to first delete the existing table.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-heading">Creating a Database</div>
            <div>
                <code>CREATE DATABASE gregs_list;</code><br>
                This will create the database. Spaces are not allowed in the name of the database. Command must end
                with a semi-colon.

                <br><br>
                <code>USE gregs_list;</code>
                <br>
                This will tell your RDBMS to actually use the database that we just created. Now everything we do will
                happen only inside the gregs_list database.

                <br><br>
                <code>CREATE TABLE my_contacts</code><br>
                <code>(</code><br>
                <code> first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,</code><br>
                <code> last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,</code><br>
                <code> email VARCHAR(30),</code><br>
                <code> gender CHAR(1),</code><br>
                <code> birthday DATE,</code><br>
                <code> numOfPets INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0</code><br>
                <code>);</code><br>
                - The comma separates the columns being created. first_name and last_name.. are the names of the
                columns. VARCHAR(30) specifies the datatype. It is used to hold information stored as a text. The (30)
                means that the text it holds can be up to 30 characters long.
                <br>
                - If there are certain columns in your table that should always have values, you can set up your table
                to not accept <code>NULL</code> values for those columns. For example, in the above table, you MUST
                provide a value for the first_name, last_name and numOfPets columns in the INSERT statement.
                <br>
                - The value that follows the DEFAULT keyword is automatically added if no other value is specified. The
                default value has to be of the same type of value as the column. This means that the numOfPets can not
                only be NOT NULL, but if no value is specified for the column, the value of 0 will be automatically
                inserted into the table, thus satisfying the requirement of the NOT NULL.
                <br>
                - So the question is: which columns should be assigned to be NOT NULL? Any columns that you might use
                later to search with, or any unique columns should be NOT NULL. Ideally you want the data in your table
                to be complete. However, if you know a column that will be filled in later, you can leave it as NULL.
                <br>
                - Remember that a column with a <code>NULL</code> value <code>IS NULL</code> but does not
                <code>EQUAL NULL</code>.


                <br><br>
                <code>DESC my_contacts;</code><br>
                This will show what your table looks like. Note that this will show ONLY the <i>structure</i> of your
                table. Not the information inside of it.

                <br><br>
                <code>SHOW CREATE TABLE my_contacts;</code><br>
                This will return the CREATE TABLE statement that can exactly recreate our table. The output from this
                command is also going to contain bacticks and what not. You can paste the output directly into the
                console and recreate the table. The bacticks and data settings don't really affect it.
                <br> The output would look something like this: <br>
                <code>CREATE TABLE `my_contacts2` (</code><br>
                <code>`first_name` varchar(30) NOT NULL,</code><br>
                <code>`last_name` varchar(30) NOT NULL,</code><br>
                <code>`email` varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,</code><br>
                <code>`gender` char(1) DEFAULT NULL,</code><br>
                <code>`birthday` date DEFAULT NULL,</code><br>
                <code>`numOfPets` int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0</code><br>
                <code>) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci</code><br>
                - Note first_name, last_name, and numOfPets are NOT NULL. email, gender, birthday on the other hand are
                DEFAULT NULL. Unless we tell the SSQL software differently, it assumes that all values are NULL by
                default.

                <br><br>
                <code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;</code><br>
                This command will display all the columns in your table, and their data type, along with any column
                specific details.

                <br><br>
                <code>SHOW CREATE DATABASE database_name;</code><br>
                Just like the SHOW CREATE table, this will return the command that would exactly recreate the specified
                database.

                <br><br>
                <code>SHOW INDEX FROM table_name;</code><br>

                <br><br>
                <code>SHOW WARNINGS;</code>


                <br><br>
                <code>INSERT INTO my_contacts</code><br>
                <code>(last_name, first_name, email, gender, birthday, numOfPets)</code><br>
                <code>VALUES</code><br>
                <code>('Doe', 'John', 'jdoe@gmail.com', 'M', '1980-09-08', 1);</code><br>
                - The values in the second set of parentheses should be in the same order as the first set of
                parentheses. This order can be different from the order in which the columns exist in the actual
                database. The important thing is that the order on lines 2 and 4 match exactly.
                <br>
                - You CAN completely omit the column names on line 2. But then the values must ALL be there, and in the
                SAME order that you originally added the columns in.
                <br>
                - You can also leave some columns out. But then the columns that you have left out will contain <code>NULL</code>.
                That is, the record will be incomplete.
                <br>
                - Any value that goes into a VARCHAR, CHAR, DATE or BLOB column has single quotes around it.
                Numeric values like DEC and INT do not need quotes (for eg. numOfPets).

                <br><br>
                <code>SELECT * FROM my_contacts</code><br>
                This will selct and print everything from the my_contacts table.

                <br><br>
                <code>DROP TABLE my_contacts;</code><br>
                This will delete the doughnut_list table. REMEMBER: DROP TABLE works whether or not there is data in
                your table. Once your table is dropped, ALL of the data in the table is gone as well. Hence use this
                command with EXTREME caution.

                <code>DATE</code>: A date. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. The supported range is from '1000-01-01' to
                '9999-12-31'
                <br>
                <code>DATETIME(fsp)</code>: A date and time combination. Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported
                range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.
                <br>
                <code>TIMESTAMP(fsp)</code>: A timestamp. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the number of seconds since the
                Unix epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from
                '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC. TIMESTAMP is usually used to capture te current
                time. DATETIME is is best used to store a future event.

        <hr>
        <div class="textual-content">
            - Instead of using the SELECT statement to return all the entries in the database, we can use it with the
            WHERE clause to fine-tune our query.
            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT * FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'Anne';</code><br>
            - Putting first_name with the WHERE clause tells SQL that you want to look in only the column called
            first_name. So what this query is saying is: return all the columns of the record r from my_contacts table
            where r.first_name = 'Anne'. Whenever you see *, as in SELECT *, think of it like asking your SQL software
            to SELECT ALL THE COLUMNS.
            <br>
            - Notice that a query on VARCHAR column datatype should always be inside quotes ''. Hence it's 'Anne' and
            not Anne. If the datatype is an INTEGER or a DECIMAL, then you do not need quotes. Only the numeric types -
            INTEGER and DECIMAL do not need quotes. The VARCHAR, CHAR, BLOB, DATE, and TIME datatypes all require
            quotes.
            <br>
            - You need to escape the single quote - use the \ (backslash) to escape the quote. for eg.
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'D\'Antonio'</code>.
            <br>
            - Do not use double quotes to specify a VARCHAR in your SQL code. You use " in the programming language to
            say "this is where the SQL statement is". That way, single quotes are recognized as being part of the SQL
            syntax and not the programming language.
            <br><br>

            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'Anne';</code><br>
            - Instead of using SELECT * that returned all the columns from the table, here we are specifying the columns
            that we want to be returned - namely - email and last_name. Note that different column names are spearated
            by a comma. This returns your queries faster.
            <br>
            Similarly you could have also used <code>WHERE first_name &lt&gt 'Anne';</code><br>. This would return all
            reuslts where the first name is NOT EQUAL to 'Anne'.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'Anne'</code><br>
            <code>AND numOfPets = 1;</code><br>
            This is using the AND keyword to combine two WHERE clauses. Note the absence of qotes in numOfPets. And that
            comparison is done using just a single <code>=</code> sign. Not <code>==</code>.
            Similarly, you can replace the equals comparison with greater than <code>AND numOfPets &gt 0</code> or NOT
            EQUAL as in <code>AND numOfPets &lt&gt 0</code>.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name =&gt 'A'</code><br>
            <code>AND first_name &lt 'B';</code><br>
            This query will return contacts whose first letter is A or later, but whose first letters come earlier than
            the alphabet B.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'Anne'</code><br>
            <code>OR numOfPets = 1;</code><br>
            Similar to AND, you can also combine 2 queries using OR.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE email IS NULL</code><br>
            This is the ONLY way to select a NULL value. By uisng the keyword <code>IS NULL</code>. DO not use things
            like <code>WHERE email = NULL</code> or <code>WHERE email = 'NULL'</code>. These are all wrong.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE location LIKE '%CA';</code><br>
            A <code>%</code> sign within single quotes tells SQL that we are looking for all values in the location
            column that END with 'CA'. The % sign is a stand-in for any number of unknown characters. Another wildcard
            is <code>_</code>. It's a standin for just ONE unknown character. So <code>WHERE location LIKE '_CA'</code>
            would have returned rows containing locations like Aca, Bca, Cca...
            <br>
            You could also have something like <code>WHERE location LIKE 'I%';</code>. This would have returned all
            locations starting with the letter I. You could also have <code>WHERE location LIKE '_e%';</code> which
            would have returned locations like Texas, Delhi, etc.
            <br>
            Remember that if your column contains complicated information, LIKE may not be specific enough to target
            precise data.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE numOfPets BETWEEN 1 AND 3;</code><br>
            BETWEEN is equivalent to using the &lt= and the &gt= symbols, but not the &gt and &lt symbols. You can also
            use the BETWEEN keyword for text data. SO you can write <code>WHERE first_name BETWEEN A AND B</code>. This
            will return the names of all the contacts that have the first character as A, or B, and everything in
            between.
            <br>
            - The order matters in the BETWEEN keyword. So the smaller value should always be on the left and the larger
            value on the right. So this would be a wrong query: <code>WHERE numOfPets BETWEEN 3 AND 1;</code>

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT email, last_name FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name IN ('Anne', 'Bianca', 'Charlize');</code><br>
            - Instead of using
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'Anne' OR first_name = 'Bianca' OR first_name = 'Charlize'</code> we can simplify
            it by using the IN keyword. Use IN with a set of values in parentheses. When the value in the column matches
            the value in the set, the entire row or the specified columns are returned.
            <br>
            - Similarly, you can use the NOT IN operator
            <code>WHERE first_name NOT IN ('Anne', 'Bianca', 'Charlize');</code>.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT * FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE numOfPets NOT BETWEEN 2 AND 4;</code><br>
            - This would return the rows where the numOfPets &lt 2 OR numOfPets &gt 4. Notice the lack of the equals
            sign.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT * FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE NOT first_name LIKE 'A%'</code><br>
            <code>AND NOT gender LIKE 'M';</code><br>
            - This wll return the contacts where the first_name does not start with an A and the gender is not M.

            <br><br>
            <code>SELECT * FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE email IS NOT NULL;</code><br>
            - This wll return the contacts from the table where email is not NULL.

        <div id="Ch3" class="sub-heading">Chapter 3: DELETE and UPDATE - Changes are good</div>
        <hr>
        <div class="textual-content">
            - Information in a table is not stored chronologically. So it's not like the record that occurs at the
            bottom of the table is the record tha twas added the last. You should not rely on the rows in the table
            being in chronological order.
            <br>
            - We use the <code>DELETE</code> keyword to remove an entire record from the table. Note that in order to
            DELETE rows from the table, you will have to turn off the "Safe Updates" by going to Edit - Preferences -
            SQL Editor - Uncheck the checkbox for safe updates.
            <br><br>
            <code>DELETE from my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE gender = 'M';</code><br>
            - Couple of points to note. Unlike the SELECT statement, we do not have to tell it what to delete. It will
            automatically delete the entire row. Also, make sure that you do not forget the WHERE clause or else it will
            delete all of the rows in your table. So never run something like <code>DELETE FROM my_contacts;</code>.
            <br>
            - The WHERE clause is the exact same as you used in the SELECT statements. Just like the previous scenarios,
            you can combine it with LIKE, IN, BETWEEN to tell the RDBMS what rows to exactly delete.

            <br><br>
            <code>DELETE FROM my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>WHERE email IS NULL;</code><br>
            <code>INSERT INTO my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>(first_name, last_name, email, gender)</code><br>
            <code>VALUES</code><br>
            <code>('Eva', 'Doe', 'edoe@gmail.com', 'F');</code><br>
            - You can use the INSERT-DELETE combo, as shown above, to update the table. First DELETE the row and then
            INSERT a new row that has the updated details.
            <br>
            - DELETE carefully. Make sure you include a precise WHERE clause to target the exact rows you really want to
            delete. Unless you are absolutely certain that your WHERE clause will delete the rows you want it to, you
            should use a SELECT first to make sure. Since DELETE and SELECT can make the same use of the same WHERE
            clause, the rows that the SELECT returns will echo the rows that the you'll DELETE with that WHERE clause.

            <br><br>
            <code>UPDATE my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>SET </code><br>
            <code>first_name = 'Evelyin',</code><br>
            <code>email = 'evedoe@gmail.com'</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'Eva';</code><br>
            - Instead of inserting a new row and deleting the old one, you can reuse an existing row, changing only the
            column values that you want to change. This is the UPDATE statement. The SET keyword tells the RDBMS that it
            needs to change the column before the equal sign to contain the value after the equal sign. The WHERE clause
            tells RDBMS on which columns the changes should be applied.
            <br>
            - You can change multiple rows in one go by using commas to separate the SET clauses. Also note how we are
            searching using the first_name in the WHERE clause and updating the same first_name in the SET clause.
            <br>
            - Just like before, if you leave out the WHERE clause, you will end up changing the first_name of EVERY
            record to Evelyin. So don't do that.

            <br><br>
            <code>UPDATE my_contacts</code><br>
            <code>SET </code><br>
            <code>numOfPets = numOfPets + 1</code><br>
            <code>WHERE first_name = 'Evelyin';</code><br>
            - In SQL, we can perform basic math operation on number columns. We are incrementing the numOfPets by 1 in
            the above example.

        <hr>
        <div class="textual-content">
            How you are going to use your data will define how you set up your table. For example, if a column
            containing address is present, you can choose to either keep the entire address as a single column, or
            divide the columns into separate Street Number, Unit Number, and so on. What you should not do is keep both
            - one column containing th entire address and the other containing the address split into its constituents.
            Because if you then have to perform an update operation on hte address, you will have to update both of
            them. So, should you split your address or not? Well, depends on how you are going to be using your data.
            <br>
            - Remember that SQL is a relational database. This means that to design a table, you need to consider how
            the columns relate to each other to describe a thing.
            <br>
            - Broad steps that you can follow when defining a table:
            <ul>
                <li>Pick the <i>one thing</i> you want your table to describe</li>
                <li>Make a <i>list of the information</i> you need to know about your one thing when you are using the
                    table
                </li>
                <li>Using the list, <i>break down the information</i> about your thing <i>into pieces</i> you can use
                    for orgainizing your tables.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="sub-heading">What is atomic data</div>
            <div>
                - When a data in a table is atomic, it means that the data has been broken into the smallest piece of
                data that <i>can't or shouldn't be divided</i>. These are some question you can ask to help you figure
                out what you need to put in your tables:
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the one thing your table describes</li>
                    <li>How will you use the table to get that one thing</li>
                    <li>Do your columns contain atomic data to make your queries short and tho the point</li>
                </ul>
                - Note that making your data atomic means breaking it down into the smallest pieces that you need to
                create an efficient table; not just the smallest pieces you possibly can. Atomic data alos helps you to
                ensure that the data in your table is accurate. For example, if you have a separatae column for street
                numbers, you can ensure that only numbers end up in that column. This also makes the computation of the
                queries faster.
                <br>
                - There are two official rules of atomic data:
                <ul>
                    <li>A column with atomic data cannot have several values of the same type of data in that column
                    </li>
                    <li>A table with atomic data can't have multiple columns with the same type of data</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="sub-heading">What is FIRST NORMAL FORM or 1NF</div>
            <div>
                - To be 1NF, a table must follow these rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>Each row of data must contain atomic values</li>
                    <li>Each row of data must have a unique identifier, known as a Primary Key</li>
                </ul>
                - Just like First Normal Form, there is also a Second and Third Normal form. Each of those adhere to
                increasingly strict sets of rules.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-heading">What is a Primary Key</div>
            <div>
                - The column that will be your Primary Key has to be designated as such when you create the table.
                <br>
                - A Primary Key is a column in your table that makes <i>each record unique</i>. Thus the primary key can
                be used to uniquely identify each record. Which, in other words, means that <i>the data in the Primary
                Key CANNOT be repeated</i>. So, for example, you would choose something like the SSN as your primary key
                (since every person has a unique SSN).
                <br>
                - For the same reasons, a Primary Key cannot be NULL either. Because other records can also be NULL. And
                that is not allowed.
                <br>
                - A Primary Key must be given a value when the record is inserted. If you insert a record without a
                Primary Key, you run the risk of ending up with a NULL primary key and duplicate rows in your table.
                This violates 1NF.
                <br>
                - The Primary Key must be compact. It should contain only as much information as it requires to be u
                nique. Nothing extra.
                <br>
                - The Primary Key values cannot be changed. If you could change the value of the Primary Key, you'd risk
                the chance of accidentally setting it to a value you have already used.
                <br>
                - Given all of these restrictions, often the best Primary Key is a new Primary key. Meaning, create a
                new column that contains a unique number. There is a debate in the SQL world about using
                <i>synthetic</i>, or made-up primary keys (like the ID column in the below example) versus using <i>natural</i>
                keys - data that is already in the table (like a VIN number on a car or the SSN number)

            each row of the table. The last line specifies that the contact_id is in fact the Primary Key of the table.
            <br>
            - Adding the keyword AUTO_INCREMENT to our contact_id allows our SQL SW to automatically fill that column
            with a value starting at 1 and incrementing in steps of 1.

            <code>VALUES ('Alice','Doe','adoe@gmail.com','F');</code><br>
            Note that the contact_id is not specified in the INSERT statement. SQL will automatically auto increment and
            generate a primary key for the entry and add it ot the record. As shown in th figure a.

            <code>VALUES (10, 'Alice','Doe','adoe@gmail.com','F');</code><br>
            You can also specify your own id. In this case the new record will be added with the id 10. As shown in

            But note that the next element that is added using AUTO_INCREMENT. In this case the contact_id assigned to

            - We said earlier that you cannot create a table with the same name as an already existing table. So suppose
            you want to make changes to an existing tbale, like adding a new column, and you want to do it without
            deleting and then recreating a new table with the same data and a new column. How do you do it? You can use
            the ALTER keyword for this purpose.

            <div class="sub-heading">What does the ALTER command allow you to change</div>
            <div>
                The ALTER command allows you to make the following changes to your table:
                <ul>
                    <li>CHANGE: both the name and datatype of an existing column*</li>
                    <li>MODIFY: the datatype or position of an existing column*</li>
                    <li>ADD: a column to your table - you pick the datatype</li>
                    <li>DROP: a columns from your table</li>
                </ul>
                The * represents that a possible loss of data may occur.
            </div>

            <br>
            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts2_withoutpkey</code><br>
            <code>ADD COLUMN contact_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT FIRST,</code><br>
            <code>ADD PRIMARY KEY (contact_id);</code><br>
            - This command will add a column to the table that will be the Primary Key of the column. The command will
            also autopopulate the column with the appropriate numbers. The FIRST keyword means that the column will be
            inserted into the first column position.

            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts2_withoutpkey</code><br>
            <code>ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(10) AFTER email;</code><br>
            The AFTER keyword tells SQL to insert the column after the email column. The AFTER keyword is optional. If
            you do not use it the column is added to the end of the table. Similarly, you can also use BEFORE, LAST,
            SECOND, THIRD, and so on.

            <br>
            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts2_withoutpkey</code><br>
            <code>RENAME TO my_contacts_2; </code><br>
            This will rename the TABLE.

            <br><br>
            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts_3</code><br>
            <code>CHANGE COLUMN contact_id my_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,</code><br>
            <code>ADD PRIMARY KEY (my_id);</code><br>
            - We are using the CHANGE COLUMN command. This means that we have to change, both, the name and the datatype
            of the column. The previous name of the column was contact_id that is now being changed to my_id. At the
            same time, we are also setting it to be the Primary key of the table. Line 3 of the command hence contains
            the new name of the column that we are saving - my_id.
            <br>
            - Remember that when you are using CHANGE COLUMN you HAVE to change both the name and the datatype of the
            COLUMN. Else SQL will complain about a syntax error.

            <br><br>
            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts_3</code><br>
            <code>CHANGE COLUMN first_name f_name VARCHAR(100),</code><br>
            <code>CHANGE COLUMN last_name l_name VARCHAR(100);</code><br>
            You can also change two columns in one statement. Here, the earlier name of the column id first_name that is
            being changed to f_name.
            <br>
            - Remember that if you change the datatype, you might lose data. For example, going from VARCHAR(10) to
            VARCHAR(1) would cause "Bonzo" to change to just "B".

            <br><br>
            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts_3</code><br>
            <code>MODIFY COLUMN f_name VARCHAR(120);</code><br>
            - This will change only the datatype of the column, and leave the name unchanged. Here f_name is the name of
            the column that we are modifying. Take care to ensure that the new datatype does not cause any truncation of
            data.
            <br>
            - There is no direct command to change the order of the columns in the table. But remember that if you want
            to fetch the data in a specific order, you can use that order in the SELECT statement that you will write
            and the data will automatically be returned to you in the specified order.

            <br><br>
            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts_3</code><br>
            <code>DROP COLUMN birthday;</code><br>
            - This will delete the birthday column and all of the data in it as well. So use this carefully.

            <br>
            You can combine all of what we have seen so far to create a SQL script. Take notice of where the commas have
            been included, and where they have been left off. There is a single Semicolon at the very end.

                <br>
                - Without an index, maintaining an autoincrement column becomes too expensive, that's why MySQL requires
                an autoincrement column to be a leftmost part of an index. Hence, you will not be able to drop the
                Primary Key without removing the AUTO_INCREMENT first.
                <br>
                <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts_3 MODIFY my_id INT NOT NULL;</code><br>
                <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts_3 DROP PRIMARY KEY;</code><br>
                The 3 snapshots of the database before ans after executing the above 2 statements are shown in the
                figures below. Notice in fig b that the my_id is still the Primary Key, but the auto_increment has been
                removed. Then in fig. c, we ahve removed the Primary Key altogether.
                <br>

            If instead of removing the AUTO_INCREMENT from a Column, you wanted to add it to a Column instead, you
            could do it using the following:
            <br>
            <code>ALTER TABLE my_contacts_3 MODIFY my_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT</code><br>
            Error Code: 1075. Incorrect table definition; there can be only one auto column and it must be defined

                - String functions allow you to select a specified number of characters from a column. None of these
                String functions change the actual data stored in the table. They simply return the altered string as a

            - Sometimes the best way to achieve atomicity in a table is to move the non-atomic columns in the table to
            new tables.

            <div class="sub-heading">What is a Database Schema</div>
            <div>
                - A representation of all the structures such as tables and columns in th database along with how they
                connect is known as a <i>schema</i>
                <br>
                - Consider the below table for example. The interests column is not atomic. Dividing the column into
                multiple columns won't work either because that will break the atomicitiy as well (multiple columns
                containing the same type of data). One option is to move the interests to another table. Which is what
                we will be doing.
                <div id="non_atomic_table" class="row">
                    <img src="resources/ch7_images/Non_Atomic_Table.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid"

                </div>
                - But if we want to move interests to another table, we will have to uniquely identify which interest
                belongs to which individual. Also this new table that we create will have to be 1NF. This is how we
                do it:
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="resources/ch7_images/Foreign_Key.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid"

                         width=55%>
                </div>
                - Note that the new table needs to be in the 1NF. Hence each record needs to be unique. For which we
                have the int_id (Primary Key) in the interests table. We also want to be able to uniquely identify the
                individual to which the value in the interest column belongs to. This is done by using the contact_id
                column.
                <br>

            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">What is a Foreign Key</div>
            - The Foreign Key is a column in a table that references the Primary Key of another table.
            <br>
            - A Foreign Key can have a different name than the Primary Key that it comes from.
            <br>
            - The primary key used by a foreign key is also known as a parent key. The table where the parent key is
            from is known as the parent table.
            <br>
            - The foreign key can be used to make sure that the rows in one table have corresponding rows in another
            table.
            <br>
            - Foreign key values can be null, even though primary key values can't. A NULL foreign key means that there
            is no matching primary key in the parent table. But we can make sure that a foreign key contains a
            meaningful value, one that exists in the parent table, by using a <i>constraint</i>.
            <br>
            - Foreign keys do not have to be unique.

            <div class="sub-heading">How do you constrain a Foreign Key</div>
            <div>
                - When you constrain your foreign key, you will only be able to insert values into your foreign key that
                exist in the table that the key came from (the parent table). This is called <i>referential
                integrity</i>. This makes sure that if you have a row in one table with a foreign key , it must
                correspond to a row in another through the foreign key. If you try to delete the row in the a primary
                key table or to change a primary key value, you will get an error if the primary key value is a foreign
                key
                constraint in another table.
                <br>
                - You can delete a row that has a primary key that shows up as a foreign key in some other table. But
                for this, you have to remove the foreign key row first. This makes sense as well because, for example,
                if you are removing the row from my_contacts, you don't need to know that person's interests anymore.
                <br>
                - You can use a foreign key to reference a <i>unique value</i> in the parent table. <i>It doesn't have
                to be the Primary key of the parent table. It just has to be unique.</i>

                create a column with the same name which we are doing on line 5. You can change the name of the column
                to any name that you like.
                <br>
                - Line 6 is the name of the constraint that is being used. As far as I can tell., this name means
                nothing.
                <br>
                - Line 8 is where the Foreign Key is actually being assigned. my_contacts_3 specifies the table from
                which the foreign key actually comes from. The my_id is what it is actually called in the other table
                (contact_id).
                <br>
                - The MUL in the figure means that multiple occurrences of the same value may be stored in this column.

            <div class="sub-heading">Relationships between Tables</div>
            <div>
                - There are 3 possible relationships that are possible between tables:
                <ul>
                    <li>one-to-one</li>
                    <li>one-to-many</li>
                    <li>many-to-many</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-heading">One-To-One Relationship</div>
            <div>
                - These types of tables are not that frequently used. One-to-one means that exactly one row of a parent
                table is related to one row of a child table.
            </div>
            <div class="row">

            <div class="sub-heading">One-To-Many Relationship</div>
            <div>
                - One-to-many relationships means that a record in table A can match many records in table B but a
                record in Table B can only match one record in Table A.

                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8217964/8742428">SO post about One-To-Many Relationships</a>
                <br>
                - Consider the following table relationship:
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="resources/ch7_images/One_To_Many_Relationship.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid"

                         width=45%>
                </div>
                - Each contact in my_contacts can have only one prof_id. But one prof_id in the professions table can
                occur
                for multiple contacts in the my_contacts table. That is - each row in professions table can have many
                matching rows in the my_contacts table. But each row in the my_contacts table will have only one
                matching
                row in the professions table.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-heading">Many-To-Many Relationship</div>
            <div>
                - We make the use of a junction table that which contains the primary key columns of the two tables that
                we are trying to relate.
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="resources/ch7_images/Many-To-Many.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid"
                         alt="Many_To_Many"
                         width=55%>
                </div>
                - A many-to-many relationship is made up of two one-to-many relationships with a junction table in
                between. <br>
                - Recall that in the <a href="#non_atomic_table">table we saw earlier</a>, one person had multiple
                interests. Also, one interest was shared by more than on person. Hence, this led to a many-to-many
                relationship. <br>
                - Using the concept of the junction table described above, we can break the many-to-many relationship as
                follows. The contact_interest table in the following example serves as the junction table.
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="resources/ch7_images/Many-To-Many_Interests.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid"

                         width=55%>
                </div>
                - One advantage of doing this is that it helps preserve data integrity. If you have to delete someone
                from the my_contacts table, you never have to touch the interests table. Just the contact_interests
                table. Also, suppose you misspelled some hobby name. When you fix it, you will only have ot change one
                row in the interests table.

            <div class="sub-heading">What is a Composite Key</div>
            <div>
                - A composite key is a Primary Key that is composed of multiple columns thus creating a unique key. <br>
                - //TODO: So other than when we create a junction tbale, why would we ever want to create a composite
                key out of columns in my table? Why not just always create an id field? The answer is basically the
                debate over creating synthetic primary keys or creating natural primary keys.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-heading">What is functional dependence between two columns</div>
            <div>
                - When a column's data must change when another column's data is modified, the first column id
                functionally dependent on the second. <br>
                - A shorthand way to define functional dependency is as follows:
                <code>T.x ->; T.y</code>: This is read like "in the relational table called T, column y is functionally
                dependent on the column x". Hence the statement is read from the right to the left. <br>
                - Thus, a dependent column is one containing data that could change if another column changes.
                Non-dependent columns stand alone. <br>
                - A <i>partial functional dependency</i> means that a non-key column is dependent on some, but not all,
                of the columns in a composite primary key. <br>
                <div class="row">

                         width=55%>
                </div>
                - A <i>transitive functional dependency</i> is one where changing any of the non-key columns might cause
                any of the other columns to change. <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="resources/ch7_images/Transitive-Functional_Dependency.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid"

            <div class="sub-heading">What is the Second Normal Form</div>
            <div>
                - Check this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/724032/8742428">SO link</a> for the proper answer <br>
                - 1NF is the most basic of normal forms - each cell in a table must contain only one piece of
                information, and there can be no duplicate rows. 2NF and 3NF are all about being dependent on the
                primary key. Recall that a primary key can be made up of multiple columns. <br>
                - The data depends on the key [1NF], the whole key [2NF] and nothing but the key [3NF] (so help me Codd)
                - For example, consider the table below:
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="resources/ch7_images/Not_In_2NF_Form.png" class="center-block img-fluid"
                         alt="Transitive-Functional_Dependency"
                         width=55%>
                </div>
                - The toy_id and the store_id are combined to form the composite primary key. In this case, the color
                column depends only on the toy_id and not the store id. Hence, it is a partial functional dependency.
                Similarly, store_address depends on the store_id but not the toy_id. Again a partial dependency. <br>
                - A 1NF table becomes a 2NF table when there are no partial functional dependencies in the table. That
                is, every column in the table depends on every column that is used to build the entire primary key in
                that table. This will also hold true if there is only one column that is the primary key in the table.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-heading">What is the Third Normal Form</div>
            <div>
                - If we are using an artificial key in our table, then achieving 2NF is easy (because that table will
                not contain a composite key, which means that there is a single column that forms the primary key which
                in turn means that every column will depend on the entire primary key by default). <br>
                - So we need to get the table into 3NF. <br>
                - For a table to be in 3 NF, we have to ensure that there are no transitive dependencies in the table.
                Recall that a transitive dependency occurs when changing one non-key column causes other columns to
                change.
