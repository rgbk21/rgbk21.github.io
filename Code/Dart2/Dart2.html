    <div class="sub-heading">Installing the Dart SDK</div>
    <div>
      - Follow the instructions <a href=" https://dart.dev/get-dart">here</a> to install the SDK. <br>
      - Verify that the SDK has been installed by running: <code>dart --version</code>. <br>
      - You can run dart code on <a href="https://dartpad.dev">dartpad.dev</a>. <br>
      - Whenever you download and open a new Dart project that contains Pub packages, you'll need to run <code>dart pub get</code> in the root folder of your project. This will
      download any libraries mentioned in <i>pubspec.yaml</i> file.
      - Check the contents of the SDK using <code>dart help</code>. This will show you the list of tools that make up the SDK. This is a list of what they are and what they do:
      <br>
      a) <code>analyze</code>: Your IDE uses this tool to tell you when you've made a mistake in your code. <br>
      b) <code>compile</code>: This tool compiles Dart code into an optimized native executable program for Windows, Linux or macOS. This is known as ahead-of-time, or AOT,
      compilation. Alongside native executables, web technologies are another major focus for Dart, so you can also use the compile tool to convert Dart code to JavaScript. <br>
      c) <code>create</code>: This is for creating new Dart projects. <br>
      d) <code>fix</code>: The fix tool is there to help developers update their old projects to use the shiniest new Dart syntax. <br>
      e) <code>format</code>: Automatic indentation of your code. <br>
      f) <code>migrate</code>: Helps migrate old projects to use null safety. <br>
      g) <code>pub</code>: Pub is the name of the package manager for Dart, and <code>pub</code> is the tool that handles the job. A package is a collection of third-party code
      that you can use in your own Dart project. You can browse packages available to you on <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a>. <br>
      h) <code>run</code>: This runs your Dart program in the Dart Virtual Machine, or VM. The Dart VM compiles your code right before it's needed. In contrast to AOT, this is
      known as just-in-time, or JIT, compilation, which will let you make small changes to your code and rerun it almost instantly. This is especially useful for applications like
      Flutter where you'll need to make lots of little changes as you refine the UI. <br>
      i) <code>test</code>: Unit testing. <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Running Dart</div>
    <div>
      - You can run a single dart file by going to the folder that has the file and then running <code>dart run <i>myDartFile.dart</i></code>. <br>
      - If you want to create a whole project, you can run <code>dart create hello_world_project</code>. This will create a Dart project with some default code. You can run this
      project by <code>cd hello_world_project</code>, and then run the project by doing <code>dart run bin/hello_dart_project.dart</code>. The <code>run</code> keyword is optional
      in the statement. <br>
      - The above command to create a project would create a simple console app because that is the default. You can create other types of project by using the
      <code>--template</code> option. You would use it like this: <code>dart create --template console-full hello_dart_project</code>.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Browsing the generated code</div>
    <div>
      - The generated code will contain something like this. The <code>List&lt;String&gt; arguments</code> is only necessary when creating command-line apps that take arguments.
      For example, in order to pass args to a dart program, you would do: <code>dart <i>myDartAppName</i> args1 args2 args3</code>. If you don't want to pass args, you can remove
      that from the method definition.

  <div class="textual-content">
    <div class="sub-heading">Adding comments</div>
    <div>
      - You add documentation comments in dart by using <code>///</code> for single line comments or <code>/** */</code> for block comments. Documentation comments also support
      Markdown formatting. <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Statements and Expressions</div>
    <div>
      - A <i>statement</i> is a command, something that you tell your computer to do. A <i>simple statement</i> is something that ends in a semicolon. So
      <code>print('Hello, Dart Apprentice reader!');</code> is a statement. <br>
      - There are also complex statements and code blocks that use curly braces, but there's no need to add semicolon after the braces. <br>
      - Unlike a statement, an <i>experession</i> doesn't do something. In other words, an expression is a value or something that can be calculated as a value. eg. 42, 3+2, 'Hello
      World'. These are all expressions. <br>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Arithmetic Operations</div>
    <div>
      - Doing something like <code>22/7</code> would print the output as 3 in some languages. Not in dart. It will give you the value <code>3.142857142857143</code>. If you
      actually did want to perform integer division, you do <code>22 ~/ 7</code>. The <code>~/</code> operator is officially called the truncating division operator when applied to
      numbers. <br>
      - The modulo operator is <code>%</code>. So <code>28 % 10</code> will print 8. <br>
      - The <code>~/</code> and <code>%</code> operators have the same precedence as multiplication and division.

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Math Functions</div>
    <div>
      - Dart has a large built-in set of math functions that you can import by doing <code>import 'dart:math';</code>. <code>dart:math</code> is one of Dart's core libraries.
      Adding the <code>import</code> statement tells the compilert that you want to use something from that library.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Variables</div>
    <div>
      - Dart has types. <code>int</code> and <code>double</code> do what their names suggest. <br>
      - 10, 3.14159 and every other value that you can assign to a variable are objects in Dart. In fact, Dart doesn't have the primitive variable types that exist in some
      languages. Everything is an object. Although <code>int</code> and <code>double</code> look like primitives, they're subclasses of <code>num</code>, which is a subclass of
      <code>Object</code>. This means you can call methods directly on the int or double value, as shown in the below code snippet. <br>
      - Also note that dart is type-safe. Means variables once declared cannot be reassigned to another type. The same rules of inheritance apply. As in variables that are subtypes
      can be assigned to a super type reference. <br>
      - Alternatively, Dart provides a <code>dynamic</code> type. Declaring a variable of this type will allow you to assign any data type you like to your variable, and the
      compiler won't warn you about anything.

    <div class="sub-heading">Type Inference</div>
    <div>
      - The <code>var</code> keyword is used to tell Dart to use whatever type it feels appropriate. Note that type safety still applies though.

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Constants</div>
    <div>
      - Dart has two different types of 'variables' whose values never change. They are declared with the <code>const</code> and <code>final</code> keywords. There is a difference
      between the two keywords.

      <br>
      <br>

      a) <p class="inline-heading"><code>const</code> constants</p>: <br>
      - To create a constant in Dart, use the <code>const</code> keyword. <code>const myConstant = 10;</code>. Just like with the <code>var</code> keyword, Dart uses type inference
      to determine that <i>myConstant</i> is an <code>int</code>. <br>
      - Once you've declared a constant, you can't change its data. So <code>myConstant = 0</code> is not allowed.

      <br>
      <br>

      b) <p class="inline-heading"><code>final</code> constants</p>: <br>
      - Often, you know you'll want a constant in your program, but you don't know what its value is at compile time. You'll only know the value after the program starts running.
      This kind of constant is known as a runtime constant. <br>
      - In Dart <code>const</code> is only used for compile-time constants; that is, for values that can be determined by the compiler before the program ever starts running. <br>
      - If you can't create a <code>const</code> variable because you don't know its value at compile time, then you must use the <code>final</code> keyword to make it a runtime
      constant. There are many reasons you might not know a value until after your program is running. For example, you might need to fetch a value from the server, or query the
      device settings, or ask a user to input their age. <br>
      - For example, <code>final hoursSinceMidnight = DateTime.now().hour;</code> <br>
      - As a general rule, try <code>const</code> first, and if the compiler complains, then make it <code>final</code>. The benefit of using <code>const</code> is it gives the
      compiler the freedom to make internal optimizations to the code before compiling it.

  <div class="textual-content">
    <div class="sub-heading">Type Inference</div>
    <div>
      - We saw earlier how dart can infer the type of the variable when it's obvious. For instance, consider the following:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/84d9a5e235cca4316d127b5e514a2629.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - Dart provides ways to check the type at runtime. There are two ways that you can do this. You can use the <code>is</code> operator to check the type. Or you can use the
      <code>runtimeType</code> property to do it. <br>
      - Dart does not do implicit type conversions. Like we saw earlier, assigning a <code>double</code> to an <code>int</code> causes compile error. If you did want to convert a
      decimal to an integer, you can do that explicitly by calling <code>toInt()</code> on the <code>double</code> object.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Casting Down</div>
    <div>
      - Suppose you have a variable of a certain supertype. But now you want to call a method on the variable that only exists on the subtype. In this case, you would have to cast
      the variable to the subtype. You use the <code>as</code> keyword to cast in dart. You need to be careful though, because if you cast to the wrong type, you get a Cast Error
      message. Point being, you cannot cast to a sibling type.

    <div class="sub-heading">Strings</div>
    <div>
      - Everything in a computer is denoted as a number. So are Strings. Strings are a sequence of characters. Each character is represented as a unique number in the computer.
      This two-way mapping between a character and a number is called a <i>character set</i>. In isolation, a computer could use any kind of mapping between a character and a
      number. For instance, you could use 1 to denote A, 2 for B and so on. But in a world where computers need to share data, you want a certain standard so that when a computer
      sends a sequence of numbers (that denote a string) to another, that other computer can reproduce the original string. <br>
      - There have been different standards over the years, but the most modern one is Unicode, at <a href="https://home.unicode.org">unicode.org</a>. <br>
      - For instance, the word "cafe" would be mapped to the following numbers "99 97 102 101" in unicode. Each of the number associated with a character is known as <i>code
      point</i>. So we would say that the letter "c" has a code point of 99. <br>
      - Unicode maps letters in other languages as well. For instance, " 我 爱 你 " would be mapped to "25105 29233 20320". <br>
      - Similarly, in dart, strings are represented as a sequence of characters as well. But what is different in the case of Dart is that it doesn't have a <code>Character</code>
      or <code>char</code> type. What this means is that in <code>final firstLetter = 'a';</code>, even though <i>firstLetter</i> is a single character, it is still of type
      <code>String</code>. <br>
      - Even though everything is a <code>String</code>, you can still get the underlying characters. <br>
      - Dart strings are a collection of UTF-16 code units. UTF-16 is a way to encode Unicode values by using 16-bit numbers. You can get the underlying character value by using
      <code>codeUnits</code>.

      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27331819/whats-the-difference-between-a-character-a-code-point-a-glyph-and-a-grapheme">What's the difference between a
      character, a code point, a glyph and a grapheme?</a> on SO. <br>
      - UTF-16 uses 16 bits to store characters and this means you can represent only 65,536 characters. But there are more characters than that. For characters that have a code
      point higher than 65,536, UTF-16 uses two code units called <i>surrogate pairs</i>. <br>
      - For example, the code point for 🎯 emoji is 127919. Which means that emoji is uniquely identified by 127919. But if you run <code>🎯.codeUnits</code> you get [55356, 57263]
      which is its surrogate pair. You can get the code point of the emoji by accessing the <code>runes</code> property of the variable. Hence, <code>🎯.runes</code> will print
      (127919). <br>
      - // TODO: If the code units for the emoji look like [55356, 57263], how does it know that it is supposed to combine the two to form an emoji, and not show the individual
      characters that are corresponding to 55356 and 57263 individually? <br>
      - But sometimes even code points can be combined. For instance, Unicode doesn't create a new code point every time there is a new country flag. It uses a pair of code points
      called regional symbols to represent a flag. For instance, <code>'🇲🇳'.runes</code> prints (127474, 127475). 127474 is the code for the regional indicator symbol letter M, and
      127475 is the code for the regional indicator symbol letter N. MN represents Mongolia. <br>
      - A more extreme example is '👨‍👩‍👧‍👦'. When you run <code>'👨‍👩‍👧‍👦'.runes</code>, you get (128104, 8205, 128105, 8205, 128103, 8205, 128102). So there are 7 code points that
      are being combined to create one emoji. If you try <code>'👨‍👩‍👧‍👦'.length</code> in order to get the length of the string, you get 11. This is because getting the length of
      the string is equivalent to finding the number of UTF-16 code units. And like we've seen we get the code units by doing <code>'👨‍👩‍👧‍👦'.codeUnits</code>. But you would expect
      the length of the emoji to be 1. <br>
      - When a string with multiple code points looks like a single character, this is known as a user perceived character. In technical terms it's called a Unicode extended
      grapheme cluster, or more commonly, just <i>grapheme cluster</i>. <br>
      - In order to correct this, we make use of an external package called <code>characters</code>. We import a package by mentioning it in the <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file.
      Indentation is important in .yaml files, so make sure to indent the package name with two spaces. The ^ carat character means that any version higher than or equal to 1.1.0
      but lower than 2.0.0 is OK to use in your project. This is known as semantic versioning.

      - Now when you try to find the length of the emoji, it will work as you expected it to. These are the code samples from the above discussion.

      - You can use either single-quote or double-quote strings in Dart. Hence, both of these are valid: "Hello", and 'Hello'. We are going to use the single-quote one since that
      is the design guide suggestion. <br>
      - You can concatenate strings by using the <code> + </code> operator like you would do in other programming languages. <br>
      - The below code snippets show the various ways in which you can concatenate strings:

    <div class="sub-heading">Objects and Dynamic Types</div>
    <div>
      - JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. Dynamic means that something can change, and for JavaScript that means the types can change at runtime. Dart is an
      optionally-typed language. That means you can choose to use Dart as a dynamically typed language or as a statically-typed language. Static means that something cannot change;
      once you tell Dart what type a variable is, you're not allowed to change it anymore. <br>
      - Like we saw earlier, dart has a <code>dynamic</code> type. A variable that has been declared as <code>dynamic</code> can be assigned any type of value. <br>
      - Also, if you declare a variable as <code>var</code> and don't assign it a value, dart treats that variable as type <code>dynamic</code>. <br>
      - If you need to explicitly say that any type is allowed, you should consider using the <code>Object?</code> type. <br>
      - At runtime, <code>Object?</code> and <code>dynamic</code> behave nearly the same. However, when you explicitly declare a variable as <code>Object?</code>, you're telling
      everyone that you generalized your variable on purpose, and that they'll need to check its type at runtime if they want to do anything specific with it. Using
      <code>dynamic</code>, on the other hand, is more like saying you don't know what the type is; you're telling people they can do what they like with this variable, but it's
      completely on them if their code crashes.

      - In the case of an else-if ladder, only the code associated with the first true condition encountered will be executed, regardless of whether there are subsequent else-if
      conditions that evaluate to true. In other words, the order of your conditions matters. You can add an else clause at the end to handle the case where none of the conditions
      are true. This else clause is optional if you don't need it. <br>
      - The ternary conditional operator takes a condition and returns one of two values, depending on whether the condition is true or false. The syntax is as follows:
      <code>(condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;</code>. <br>
      - In Dart, <code>switch</code> statements don't support ranges like <code>number > 5</code>. Only <code>==</code> equality checking is allowed. If your conditions involve
      ranges, then you should use if statements. <code>switch</code> statements can also work with Strings.

    <div class="sub-heading">Enumerated Types and Looping</div>
    <div>
      - Name of the enum is normally written with a capital letter, for instance, <i>Weather</i>. The individual enums are written in camelCase. <br>
      - You can use for-in loops to iterate over collections. It doesn't provide an index. Example of using enum.

      - <code>main</code> is also a function. It is the function that every Dart program starts with. Since <code>main</code> doesn't return a value, the return type of
      <code>main</code> must be <code>void</code>. <code>main</code> can also take parameters if required. <br>
      - Note that in the below example <i>compliment</i> is outside <code>main</code>. Dart supports top-level functions, which are functions that aren't inside a class or another
      function. <br>

      - A parameter is the name and type that you define as an input for your function. An argument , on the other hand, is the actual value that you pass in. A parameter is
      abstract, while an argument is concrete.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Making parameters optional</div>
    <div>
      - To indicate that a parameter is optional, you surround the parameter with square brackets and add a question mark after the type. Adding the <code>?</code> would mean that
      the parameter can be null, in which case the method would have to handle the case where the parameter is null explicitly. Alternatively, you can provide default values for
      the optional parameters. <br>
      - Note that you cannot use the <code>required</code> keyword with the [] notation. It is a compile error.

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Naming parameters</div>
    <div>
      - Dart allows you to use named parameters to make the meaning of the parameters more clear in function calls. To create a named parameter you surround it with curly braces
      instead of square brackets. <br>
      - Note that named parameters are still optional. <br>
      - Similar to the [] notation, you can provide default values for parameters that are implicitly null. Else you can force the user to pass a value as an argument while calling
      the method by using the <code>required</code> keyword. <br>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Functions and side-effects</div>
    <div>
      - When you write a function, you know what the inputs are: the parameters. You also know what the output is: the return value. Anything beyond that, that is, anything that
      affects the world outside the function, is a side effect. For example if a function prints something to the console, then that printing counts as a side-effect. <br>
      - An example:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/c540efcc7deb89bb6d789ad762e730b2.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      - It is necessary for some functions to have side effects. But as a general rule, functions without side effects are easier to deal with and reason about because the do
      <i>exactly</i> what you expect them to do <i>everytime</i> that you pass in the same input. These kinds of functions are also called pure functions.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Functions and Optional types</div>
    <div>
      - Like we said earlier, Dart is an optionally typed language, which means that you can omit the types from your function declaration. And do monstrous things like this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Anonymous Functions</div>
    <div>
      - Functions that we saw so far had a name and a return type. If you remove the name and the return type, what you get is an anonymous function. The return type is inferred
      from the return value of the function body. <br>
      - In dart, function are first-class citizens, which means that you can treat them like any other type. You can assign functions as values to variables, pass functions around
      as parameters to other functions, and return functions from other functions. <br>
      - <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.0.6/dart-core/Function-class.html">Functions doc on Dart site</a>. Read entire page. <br>
      - Let us look at how to do these things one-by-one:

      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Assigning functions to variables</p>: <br>
      - The type of the variable to use for assigning a function is <code>Function</code>.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>

      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Passing functions to functions</p>: <br>
      - Just as you can write a function to take <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> as a parameter, you can also have <code>Function</code> as a parameter. <br>
      - Functions that accept other functions as parameters are called <i>higher-order functions</i>. <br>
      - A function type also has a <code>call</code> method with a signature that has the same function type as the function type itself. Calling the <code>call</code> method
      behaves just as calling the function. This is mainly used to conditionally call a nullable function value.
      <div class="code-block">

        </div>
      </div>

      <br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Returning functions from functions</p>: <br>
      - Just as you can pass in functions as input parameters, you can also return them as output.
      - Similar to functions that accept other functions as parameters, functions that return other functions are also called <i>higher-order functions</i>. <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">The problem with using functions the way we defined above, and what to do about it</div>
    <div>
      - Consider the example we used above. If we do something like we are doing in the below example, we do not get any compile errors. It is only when we run the program that
      we get exceptions.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>

      - The problem is that the <code>Function</code> type does not carry information about the parameter signatures or return type of a function. To express a more precise
      function type, use the function type syntax, which is the <code>Function</code> keyword followed by a parameter list, or a type argument list and a parameter list, and which
      can also have an optional return type. <br>
      - The function type syntax mirrors the definition of a function, with the function name replaced by the word "Function." <br>
      - So for instance, declaring a function literal of type <code>String Function(int)</code> would point to a function that accepts an <code>int</code> type as argument and
      returns a <code>String</code> type. <br>
      - So the above example that threw the exception can be rewritten using types so that the compiler warns us when we try to incorrectly call the function. We can do it like
      this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Closures and Scopes</div>
    <div>
      - Anonymous functions in Dart act as what are known as closures. The term closure means that the code "closes around" the surrounding scope, and therefore has access to
      variables and functions defined within that scope. <br>
      - A "scope" in Dart is defined by a pair of curly braces. All the code within these braces is a scope. You can have nested scopes within other scopes. Examples of scopes are
      function bodies and bodies of loops. <br>
      - Already forgotten what Closures were supposed to be. <a href="../JavaScript/JavaScript.html#JS_Closures">Read about it on the JS page here</a>.

      - All values in Dart are objects that are built from a class. This includes the values of basic types like <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>bool</code>.
      That's different from other languages like Java where basic types are primitive. For example, if you have <code>x = 10</code> in java, the value of <i>x</i> is 10 itself.
      However, Dart doesn't have primitive types. Even for a simple <code>int</code>, the value is an object that wraps the integer. <br>

      - Note that you cannot assign values to variables that you have declared as <code>final</code> in the constructor, like you can do in java. <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42864913/how-do-i-initialize-a-final-class-property-in-a-constructor">SO question</a> that explains what to do.

    <div class="sub-heading">Understanding Object Serialization</div>
    <div>
      - <i>Serialization</i> is the process of converting a complex data object into a string. Once the object has been serialized, it's easy to save that data or transfer it
      across the network because everything from your app to the network and beyond knows how to deal with strings. Later, when you want to read that data back in, you can do so by
      way of <i>deserialization</i>, which is simply the process of converting a string back into an object of your datatype. <br>
      - Serialization and Deserialization are such common tasks that people have devised a number of standardized formats for serializing data. One of the most common ones is
      called JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. <br>
      - In JSON, objects are surrounded by curly braces, properties are separated by commas, property names are separated from property values by colons, and strings are surrounded
      by double-quotes. If a string needs to include double-quotes inside itself, you can escape it with a backslash like so: <code>\"</code>. <br>
      - JSON is very similar to a Dart data type called <code>Map</code>. In fact, Dart even has built-in functions in the <code>dart:convert</code> library to serialize and
      deserialize JSON maps. We will look at this later.

    <div class="sub-heading">Constructor</div>
    <div>
      - The <i>User</i> class that we looked at above did not have an explicit constructor. In cases like this, Dart provides a default constructor that takes no parameters and
      just returns an instance of the class. This is what we were using in the above case. <br>
      - The other option is to pass parameters to the constructor name so that Dart can know how to build your object. <br>
      - There are different types of constructors that Dart provides: <br>
      a) Long-form constructor <br>
      b) Short-form constructor <br>
      c) Named constructor <br>

      - The long-form and short-form constructor use just the class name. These are also known as <i>unnamed constructors</i>. <br>
      - The below examples show the usage of all the three types of constructor.

    <div class="sub-heading">Forwarding Constructors</div>
    <div>
      - This is similar to chaining constructors in java.

      </div>

      - Everything we saw in the optional and named parameters in functions also carries over to constructors. Constructors can also be defined with named and optional parameters.

    <div class="sub-heading">Private variables and Initializer Lists</div>
    <div>
      - Dart allows you to make variables private by adding an underscore in front of their name. Note that named parameters cannot start with an <code>_</code>. <br>
      - Also note that when a constructor contains both an initializer list and a body, the initializer list gets executed before the body of the constructor. <br>
      - Also note that private variables are library private, not class private. <br>
      - A good use of initializer lists is sanity check of the input.

    <div class="sub-heading">Making properties and classes immutable</div>
    <div>
      - There are two ways to mark a variable immutable in Dart: <code>final</code> and <code>const</code>. hwever, since the compiler won't know what the properties are until
      runtime, your only choice here is to use <code>final</code>. <br>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">

        </div>
      </div>

      - If the objects of a particular class can never change, because all fields of the class are <code>final</code>, you can add <code>const</code> to the constructor to ensure
      that all instances of the class will be constants at compile-time. In the above class, since both <i>_id</i> and <i>_name</i> were final, we can mark the class itself as
      <code>const</code>.

        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-heading">Factory Constructors</div>
    <div>
      - All the constructors we saw above were generative constructors, which means that they can only create a <i>new</i> instance of the class. <br>
      - Factory constructors on the other hand can <i>return</i> existing instances oth the class, or even subclasses of it. <br>
      - <a href="https://dart.dev/language/constructors#factory-constructors">The official dart docs</a> have a better explanation of it. <br>
      - Use the <code>factory</code> keyword when implementing a constructor that doesn't always create a new instance of its class. For example, a <code>factory</code> constructor
      might return an instance from a cache, or it might return an instance of a subtype. Another use case for <code>factory</code> constructors is initializing a <code>final</code>
      variable using logic that can't be handled in the initializer list.
