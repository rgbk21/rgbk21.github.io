        <div class="sub-heading">What is a Java Bean</div>
        <div class="textual-content">
            - A <i>Java Bean</i> is a software content that has been designed to be reusable in a variety of different
            environments. There is no restriction in the capability (in terms of complexity) of a Java Bean. A bean may
            perform a simple function or a complicated function.
            <br>
            - At a basic level, <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21866571/difference-between-javabean-and-spring-bean">JavaBeans
            are simply Java classes</a> which adhere to certain coding conventions.
            Specifically, classes that have:
            <ul>
                <li><code>public</code> default (no argument) constructors</li>
                <li>allow access to their properties using accessor (getter and setter) methods</li>
                <li>implement <code>java.io.Serializable</code></li>
                <li>all JavaBean instance variables should be private</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">What is the difference between a Java Bean and a POJO</div>
        <div class="textual-content">
            - A JavaBean follows <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1394265/what-is-the-difference-between-a-javabean-and-a-pojo">certain
            conventions</a>. Getter/setter naming, having a public default constructor, being
            serializable etc. See <a href="https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jnut/ch06_02.htm">JavaBeans
            Conventions</a> for more details.
            <br>
            - A POJO (plain-old-Java-object) isn't rigorously defined. It's a Java object that doesn't have a
            requirement
            to implement a particular interface or derive from a particular base class, or make use of particular
            annotations in order to be compatible with a given framework, and can be any arbitrary (often relatively
            simple) Java object.
            <br>
            - All JavaBeans are POJOs but not all POJOs are JavaBeans.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">What is the difference between a Java Bean and a Spring Bean</div>
        <div class="textual-content">
            - A Spring bean is basically an object managed by Spring. More specifically, it is an object that is
            instantiated, configured and otherwise managed by a Spring Framework container. Spring beans are defined in
            Spring configuration files (or, more recently, with annotations), instantiated by Spring containers, and
            then injected into applications.
            <br>
            - Note that Spring beans need not always be JavaBeans. Spring beans might not implement the
            <code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface, can have arguments in their constructors, etc.
            This is the very basic difference between JavaBeans and Spring beans.
            <br>
            - <a href="http://www.shaunabram.com/beans-vs-pojos/">The reason Spring managed objects are referred to as
            beans</a> is because in the very early versions, Spring was
            intended only for use with JavaBeans. That is no longer the case of course: Spring can manage just about any
            object, even if it doesn’t have JavaBean type characteristics such as default constructors or mutator
            methods (getters and setters). None the less, the term ‘Spring beans’ has stuck.
            Can Spring beans be POJOs? Yes, and they usually are (although they don’t have to be – e.g. Spring can be
            used with ‘heavyweight’ Java objects, such as EJBs).
            Can Spring beans be JavaBeans? As I have said, yes and again they often are but don’t have to be.

            of a Bean</a></div>
        <div class="textual-content">
            A JavaBean on its own is not terribly interesting, it's just a Java class that conforms to some standards.
            However, conformance with this standard is one of the pillars on which the Java EE
            framework is built and it comes up in quite a few places. FYI, there are a few different types of EJB listed
            below:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Entity Beans</b>:</li>
                <div>You might want to read/write objects to/from an underlying database. You could use JDBC/SQL to do
                    this but you could also use a persistance framework. The Java EE spec includes a spec for
                    persistance whereby you declare your class to be an "entity bean" and have Java automatically
                    generate database tables and logic to map between entries in your database and objects in your
                    program. The actual implementation is provided by a lower level library such as Eclipselink,
                    Toplink, Hibernate etc. but the Java API abstracts away any differences between them.
                    <br>
                    Session beans represent logic while entity beans represented persistent objects. <a
                            href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13501659/8742428">These days entity
                        beans aren't used anymore in favour to JPA entities.</a>
                </div>
                <li><b>Stateful Session Beans</b></li>
                <div>
                    Imagine that you want to create an instance of a Java class which exists on separate JVM. The JVMs
                    might be running on the same physical machine but equally, may be on separate machines communicating
                    over a network. Using a Java EE application server, you can create a class which can be instantiated
                    by clients of the app server. These clients can instantiate a class which will act just like a
                    normal object but any methods that are invoked on the object get executed on the server with the
                    results being passed back to the caller. It's basically an object oriented form of remote procedure
                    calls.
                </div>
                <li><b>Stateless Session Beans</b></li>
                <div>
                    This is a minor variation on stateful session beans. With stateful beans, if the server has 1000
                    clients then it will potentially have to create 1000 instances of the bean and remember which
                    instance belongs to which client. With stateless beans, the server creates a pool of beans and
                    doesn't bother to remember which client owns which bean. When a client invokes a method, the server
                    picks a bean from the pool and uses it, returning it to the pool on completion. You use stateful
                    session beans when you want the server to remember details about each client, you will use stateless
                    beans when you don't need to remember client specific details. Note that the stateless beans may
                    well have state, it's just that this state won't be of interest to the client.
                </div>
                <li><b>Singleton Beans</b></li>
                <div>
                    //TODO..?
                </div>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Introspection</div>
        <div class="textual-content">
            Introspection is the automatic process of analyzing a bean's design patterns to reveal the bean's
            properties, events, and methods. This process controls the publishing and discovery of bean operations and
            properties.
            <br>
            There are two ways in which the developer of a Bean can indicate which of its properties, events, and
            methods should be exposed. With the first method, simple naming conventions are used. These allow the
            introspection mechanisms to infer information about a Bean. In the second way, an additional class that
            extends the <code>BeanInfo</code> interface is provided that explicitly supplies this information.
            <br>
            The introspection mechanism finds all of the public methods of a Bean. Protected and private methods are not
            presented.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Design Pattern for Properties</div>
        <div class="textual-content">
            A <i>property</i> is a subset of a Bean’s state. The values assigned to the properties determine the
            behavior and
            appearance of that component. A property is set through a setter method. A property is obtained by a getter
            method. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/writing/properties.html">There are two
            types of properties:</a>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Simple</b>:
                    A simple property has a single value. It can be identified by the following design patterns, where
                    <code>N</code> is the name of the property and <code>T</code> is its type:
                    <br>
                    <code>public T getN()</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>public void setN(T arg)</code>
                    <br>
                    A read/write property has both of these methods to access its values. A read-only property has only
                    a get method. A write-only property has only a set method.
                </li>
                <li><b>Indexed</b>:
                    An indexed property consists of multiple values. It can be identified by the following design
                    patterns, where <code>N</code> is the name of the property and <code>T</code> is its type:
                    <br>
                    <code>public T getN(int index);</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>public void setN(int index, T value);</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>public T[] getN();</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>public void setN(T values[]);</code>
                    <br>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">Design Pattern for Events</div>
        <div>
            Beans use the delegation event model that was discussed earlier in this book. Beans can generate events and
            send them to other objects. These can be identified by the following design patterns, where <code>T</code>
            is the type of the event:
            <br>
            <code>public void addTListener(TListener eventListener)</code>
            <br>
            <code>public void addTListener(TListener eventListener) throws java.util.TooManyListenersException</code>
            <br>
            <code>public void removeTListener(TListener eventListener)</code>
            <br>
            These methods are used to add or remove a listener for the specified event. The version of
            <code>addTListener()</code> that does not throw an exception can be used to <i>multicast</i> an event, which
            means that more than one listener can register for the event notification. The version that throws <code>TooManyListenersException</code>
            <i>unicasts</i> the event, which means that the number of listeners can be restricted to one. In either
            case, <code>removeTListener()</code> is used to remove the listener.
            <br>
            //TODO: Example code of how to actually use a listener to listen for an event and take action based on it.

        Terminology:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Web Server</b>:
                A web browser lets a user request a resource. The web server receives the request, finds the resource,
                and
                then sends it back to the user. A resource can be anything - HTML page, image, PDF File. If the
                requested
                resource is not found, the server replies with a <code>404-Not Found</code> error code.
                <br>
                - A web server can refer to either the physical machine (hardware) or the web server application
                (software).
            </li>
            <li><b>Web Client</b>:
                Both the human and the browser application (Mozilla, Chrome) being used are referred to as the Web
                Client. A
                web browser can communicate with the web server. It can interpret the HTML code that is send as a part
                of
                the server's response and render that web page. Hence a Web Client (browser) lets the user request
                something
                from the server and shows the user the result of that request.
            </li>
            <li><b>HTML</b>: When a server answers a request, the server usually sends some type of content for the
                browser to
                display. This content is written in HTML.
                <br>
                - Two important tags in HTML are:
                <code>form</code> and <code>input</code>
                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7ccd6f864eb2faf71f645955dfe6c4d2.js"></script>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><b>HTTP</b>: Most of the conversations held on the web between clients and servers are held using HTTP
                Protocol, which allows for simple request- response type conversations. The client sends an
                <code>HTTP Request</code> and the Server responds with a <code>HTTP Response</code>.
                <br>
                HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP. The structure of and HTTP conversation is a simple Request/Response.
                <br><b>Key elements of the request stream are:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTTP Method Name(the action to be performed): The method name tells the server the kind of
                        request that is being made, and how the rest of the message will be formatted. The
                        <code>HTTP</code> protocol has several methods, but we mostly use <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>
                        methods.
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>GET</code>: Gets a resource (HTML page, image, file,..) from the server and sends
                                it back to the Client. You can also send some data with a <code>GET</code> request, but
                                this is not recommended. Firstly, because the number of characters that are sent via a
                                <code>GET</code> request are limited and secondly all the data sent in a
                                <code>GET</code> request is visible in the URL. The "?" separates the path and the
                                parameters. Together, the entire String is the request that is the URL that is sent with
                                the request.

                            <li><code>POST</code>: With POST, you can request something and at the same time send form
                                data to the server. For eg., if the user has completed a long form, you want this data
                                to be stored into a database. In this case you would use a <code>POST</code> method. The
                                data to be sent back to the server is known as the "payload" or the "message body".

                    <li>Content-type (text, picture, HTML). Also known as MIME type</li>
                    <li>The actual content</li>

                - An HTTP response can contain HTML. HTTP adds a Header to the response generated by the server. This
                Header information helps the client process the response. Inside this response can be a
                <code>&lthtml&gt&lt/html&gt </code> that the client then renders as the HTML page that we finally see.

            <b>What is a TCP Port</b>:
            <br>
            A TCP port is a 16-bit number that uniquely identifies the software that is running
            on the hardware. They are NOT physical ports on a system. They are just numbers representing an
            applications. As per the standard, the HTTP Server Software runs on Port 80. Without port numbers, the
            Server would have no  way of telling which application/software a Client wants to connect to.
            <br>
            - There are a bunch of other ports that are pre-defined to connect to specific services.

        <div>
            <b>Two things the Server won't do on its own:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic Content: The Web Server Application serves only static pages, but a spearate "helper"
                    application that the web server can communicate with can build non-static, just-in-time web pages.
                    Just-in-time web pages do not exist before the request comes in. Once the request comes in, the
                    helper app "writes" the HTML and the web server sends the page back to the Client as if it were a
                    static web page.
                </li>
                <li>Saving data on the Server: A WEb Server cannot process form data. When the web server sees a request
                    for a helper app, it assumes that all of the parameters are emant for the Helper app and hence
                    passes all of the parameters to it
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>What is a Servlet? And what is JSP?</b>
            <br>
            - The Helper App in Java is known as a Servlet. So a Servlet is just some Java code. But when the web server
            calls the helper Servlet, it expects HTML code in return. This is done by using using the <code>PrintWriter.println()</code>
            method. The HTML code that is to be returned to the web server is included as a <code>String</code> type
            argument in the <code>println()</code> method. As you can hope, stuffing properly formatted HTML tags into
            the <code>println()</code>is not a viable solution. For eg. you will have to manually escape every quote
            character (") because Java treats them as end of string character. And HTML happens to use a ton of quotes
            to specify the attribute values and what not.
            <br>
            - To solve this problem, JSPs were introduced. This allows us to add Java code to HTML instead of writing
            HTML code in a Java class. The JSP page contains java variables that calls the main Java code and creates
            the completed HTML page as a JIT web page.
