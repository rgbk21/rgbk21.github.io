            You cannot pass <code>int</code> by reference in Java. Wrapping an <code>int</code> into an
            <code>Integer</code> class also does not help
            because <code>Integer</code> is immutable. What you can do is store the integer in an <code>int[]</code>
            array and then pass the array by reference.

        5) Why do we get one extra negative number?
        <div>
            When representing a number in 32 bits, the highest bit is used as a sign bit, so when representing a number
            like 2147483647 in binary, it is 01111...111 (31 bits that are 1's).
            <br>
            When we add one more to that we get:
            <br>
            10000...000 (31 0's)
            However, because of a need to avoid representing 0 twice (once as 00..0 and other time as 100..0), we wrap
            the number, so instead of 100..0 representing -0, this represents negative 2147483648 (not negative
            2147483647
            because the positive side needed to represent 0, but as the negative side doesn't, we get one "extra"
            negative number).

        7) Is Java pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?
        <div>
            Strictly speaking, for references it's "pass reference by value" and for primitives it's just "pass by
            value" -
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3330864/how-can-i-pass-an-integer-class-correctly-by-reference">Source</a>
            <br>
            (From Java: The Complete Reference)
            <br>
            Although Java uses call-by-value to pass all arguments, the precise effect differs between whether a
            primitive
            type or a reference type is passed.
            <br>
            When you pass a primitive type to a method, it is passed by value. Thus, a copy of the argument is made, and
            what occurs to the parameter that receives the argument has no effect outside the method.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/34c8ceae9366e91b9750e57e5686f1cf.js"></script>
            </div>
            When you pass an object to a method, the situation changes dramatically, because objects are passed by what
            is effectively call-by-reference. Keep in mind that when you create a variable of a class type, you are only
            creating a reference to an object. Thus, when you pass this reference to a method, the parameter that
            receives it will refer to the same object as that referred to by the argument. This effectively means that
            objects act as if they are passed to methods by use of call-by-reference. Changes to the object inside the
            method do affect the object used as an argument.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/4c82cbaabf73d58cdef8153a356bdfe8.js"></script>
            </div>
            Remember: When an object reference is passed to a method, the reference itself is passed by use of
            call-by-value. However, since the value being passed refers to an object, the copy of that value will still
            refer to the same object that its corresponding argument does.

        10) What is the difference between a "class method" and an "instance method"?
        <div>
            Instance methods use an instance of a class, whereas a class method can be used with just the class name.
            A class method is called a "static" method in many languages. Accessors (Getters and Setters) are instance
            methods
            because they are setting and getting the state of a specific instance.
            <br>
            Along the same lines, you also have "class variables", "instance variables", and "local variables"
            <br>
            <b>Local variable</b>: is declared inside a method/constructor or within a block (enclosed in braces) and
            must be
            initialized before use, otherwise it won't compile.
            <br>
            <b>Instance variable</b>: is declared inside a class. It's initialization is not compulsory. If omitted, it
            contains default value (0, 0.0, false, null, etc.). Every instance of that class (object) has it's own copy
            of that variable. Changes made to the variable don't reflect in other instances of that class.
            <br>
            <b>Class variables</b>: These are also known as static member variables and there's only one copy of that
            variable
            that is shared with all instances of that class. If changes are made to that variable, all other instances
            will see the effect of the changes.

        - One way is you change the value returned on comparison. That is, when a > b, return -1 instead of +1 (for
        sorting in descending). Returning +1 sorts it in ascending, returning -1 sorts it in descending. <br>
        - Second way is you change the order in which you compare the objects. That is, if b > a, return 1. That will

        45) Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions <br>
        - <a

        Java, there are two types of exceptions</a>: checked exceptions and un-checked exceptions. A checked exception
        must be handled explicitly by the code, whereas, an un-checked exception does not need to be explicitly handled.
        <br>
        - For checked exceptions, you either have to put a try/catch block around the code that could potentially throw
        the exception, or add a "throws" clause to the method, to indicate that the method might throw this type of
        exception (which must be handled in the calling class or above). <br>
        - Any exception that derives from <code>Exception</code> is a checked exception, whereas a class that derives
        from
        <code>RuntimeException</code> is un-checked. RuntimeExceptions do not need to be explicitly handled by the
        calling code.

        58) Difference between Abstract classes and interface in java 8 <br>
        - Java Doc Source <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html">here</a>. <br>
        - An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract - it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract
        classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. <br>
        - An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a
        semicolon), like this: <br>
        <code>abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);</code> <br>
        - If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself <i>must</i> be declared abstract. <br>
        - When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract
        methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract. <br>
        - Methods in an interface that are not declared as default or static are implicitly
        abstract, so the abstract modifier is not used with interface methods. (It can be used, but it is unnecessary.)
        <br>
        - You <code>extends</code> a abstract class. You do not <code>implements</code> an abstract class.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Abstract Classes Compared to Interfaces: <br>
        - All methods in an interface are implicitly <code>public</code> and <code>abstract</code> (but not
        <code>final</code>). All fields in an interface are implicitly <code>public</code>, <code>static</code> and
        <code>final</code>. <br>


    </div>

    <div class="one-point">
        59) Why are methods declared <code>final</code>? <br>
        - You can declare some or all of a class's methods <code>final</code>. You use the <code>final</code> keyword in
        a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. <br>
        - You might wish to make a method <code>final</code> if it has an implementation that should not be changed and
        it is critical to the consistent state of the object. <br>
        - Methods called from constructors should generally be declared <code>final</code>. If a constructor calls a
        non-final method, a subclass may redefine that method with surprising or undesirable results. <br>
        - Note that you can also declare an entire class <code>final</code>. A class that is declared <code>final</code>
        cannot be subclassed. This is particularly useful, for example, when creating an immutable class like the String
        class. <br>

        Traditional Compiler vs JIT Compiler vs AOT Compiler? <br>
        - The main thing to keep in mind: JVM has, both, an interpreter as well as a compiler. With JVM, both
        interpreter
        and compiler (the JVM compiler and not the source-code compiler like javac) produce native code (aka Machine
        language code for the underlying physical CPU like x86)
        from byte code. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40876067/8742428">Source on SO</a>. So when people talk
        about compiling java code, there are two different compilers in picture - one is the <code>javac</code> compiler
        converting the .java files to .class files and then there is the compiler in the JVM itself that is converting
        <i>parts</i> of the bytecode to native instructions that can be run on the CPU/machine code (This is the
        JIT-Compilation that people refer to). <br>

        - First of all, <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3440297/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-compiled-language-or-interpreted-language">there
        is no such thing as a "compiled language" or an "interpreted language"</a>. <br>
        - Generally, both interpreters and compilers first need to parse the source code and turn it into a
        representation, called AST (abstract syntax tree). A compiler then turns the AST into executable code (through
        various transformations), while an interpreter might just directly 'interpret' the AST or sometimes compile and
        execute it (just-in-time compilation).
        The statement that there is nothing like a "compiled language" or an "interpreted language" is correct in that
        this has nothing to do with the language: in theory, you can write an
        interpreter and compiler for any language. Which one to use really depends on the use-case, scenario and
        environment.
        A compiler has the advantage that it only needs to do it's job once, regardless of how often you then execute
        the program. An interpreter needs to parse the source every time (or do some caching), thus you have an overhead
        for each execution which might take way longer than the actual execution time of the final program. On the other
        hand, an interpreter is more flexible (it can take into amount the current environment and thus do optimizations
        a compiler is not allowed to do). But the differences don't stop here, these are just two obvious points. <a

        <br>
        <br>

        <li><u>Compiler vs Interpreter</u></li>
        - So we first need to understand what is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter. Check <a
            href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/269878">Source on SO here</a>. <br>
        - To convert source code into machine code, we use either a compiler or an interpreter. Both compilers and
        interpreters are used to convert a program written in a high-level language into machine code understood by
        computers. However, there are differences between how an interpreter and a compiler works. Look at the
        interpreter vs compiler table at
        <a href="https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter">this link</a> and <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30669166/8742428">this SO answer</a>. <br>
        - On a higher level, the difference really comes down to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/475286/8742428">'prepare
        the code for later execution' (compilation) or 'execute the code right now' (interpretation)</a>. Some
        interpreters (e.g. Unix shells) read the description one small piece at a time and act on each piece as they see
        it; some (e.g. Perl, Python) read the entire description, internally convert it to a simpler form and then act
        on that. Some interpreters (e.g. Java's JVM, or a Pentium 4 chip) only understand a very simple description
        language that is too tedious for humans to work with directly, so humans use compilers to convert their
        high-level descriptions to this language. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/475461/8742428">Compilers never
        do the work. Interpreters always do the work</a>. <br>
        - A compiled language is one where the program, once compiled,
        is expressed in the instructions of the target machine. For example, an addition "+" operation in your source
        code could be translated directly to the "ADD" instruction in machine code.
        An interpreted language is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but
        instead read and executed by some other program (which normally is written in the language of the native
        machine). For example, the same "+" operation would be recognised by the interpreter at <i>run-time</i>, which
        would
        then call its own "add(a,b)" function with the appropriate arguments, which would then <i>execute</i> the
        machine code
        "ADD" instruction. (Note that, in the case of interpreted languages, all of this is happening during run-time.)
        <br>
        - Advantages of compiled languages: <br>
        a) Faster performance by directly using the native code of the target machine. It takes large amount of time to
        analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. <br>
        b) Opportunity to apply quite powerful optimisations during the compile stage <br>
        - Disadvantages of compiled languages: <br>
        a) Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. <br>
        b) It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard.
        <br>
        - Advantages/disadvantages of interpreted languages: <br>
        a) Easier to implement (writing good compilers is very hard!!) <br>
        b) No need to run a compilation stage: can execute code directly "on the fly". It takes less amount of time to
        analyze the source code and <i>start</i> running it, but the overall execution time is slower. <br>
        c) Can be more convenient for dynamic languages <br>
        d) No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient. <br>
        e) Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is
        easy. <br>
        Note that modern techniques such as bytecode compilation add some extra complexity - what happens here is that
        the compiler targets a "virtual machine" which is not the same as the underlying hardware. These virtual machine
        instructions can then be compiled again at a later stage to get native code (e.g. as done by the Java JVM JIT
        compiler). <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3265602/8742428">Source on SO here</a>. <br>
        - You can now see the problem with a purely interpreted language. A traditional compiler is translating all the
        source code to machine code <i>before</i> the execution of the program. Hence at runtime, all the CPU has to do
        is run the machine code instructions (for eg. ADD). On the other hand, for a purely interpreted language, the
        source code needs to
        be translated to the machine code for every instruction - <i>at runtime</i>. If an instruction is present in a
        loop, the interpreter might end up translating the same source code to machine code millions of time. This is a
        huge overhead.

        - An interpreter pretty much converts each byte-code instruction to corresponding native instruction by looking
        up
        a predefined JVM-instruction to machine instruction mapping (see below pic). Interestingly, a further speedup in
        execution can be achieved, if we take a section of byte-code and convert it into machine code - because
        considering a whole logical section often provides rooms for optimization as opposed to converting
        (interpreting) each line in isolation (to machine instruction). This very act of converting a section of
        byte-code into (presumably optimized) machine instruction is called compiling (in the current context). When the
        compilation is done at run-time, the compiler is called JIT compiler.

        Since Java designer went for (hardware & OS) portability, they had chosen interpreter architecture (as opposed
        to c style compiling, assembling, and linking). However, in order to achieve more speed up, a compiler is also
        optionally added to a JVM. Nonetheless, as a program goes on being interpreted (and executed in physical CPU)
        "hotspot"s are detected by JVM and statistics are generated. Consequently, using statistics from interpreter,
        those sections become candidate for compilation (optimized native code). It is in fact done on-the-fly (thus JIT
        compiler) and the compiled machine instructions are used subsequently (rather than being interpreted). In a
        natural way, JVM also caches such compiled pieces of code.

        - Java implementations typically use a two-step compilation process. Java source code is compiled down to
        bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use a
        technique called <i>Just-in-Time (JIT)</i> compilation to compile the bytecode to native instructions understood
        by
        hardware CPU on the fly at runtime. Some implementations of JVM may choose to <i>interpret</i> the bytecode
        instead of
        JIT compiling it to machine code, and running it directly. While this is still considered an "interpreter," it's
        quite different from interpreters that read and execute the high level source code (i.e. in this case, Java
        source code is not interpreted directly, the bytecode, output of Java compiler, is). It is technically possible
        to compile Java down to native code ahead-of-time and run the resulting binary. It is also possible to interpret
        the Java code directly. <br>
        - To summarize, depending on the execution environment, bytecode can be: <br>
        a) compiled ahead of time and executed as native code (similar to most C++ compilers) <br>
        b) compiled just-in-time and executed <br>
        c) interpreted <br>
        d) directly executed by a supported processor (bytecode is the native instruction set of some CPUs) <br>

        - Browsers are pretty smart when it comes to caching. It should only ask for it once.
        Additionally when it asks the server for an image, it usually sends with the request for the image, a couple of
        headers that tell the server.. Hey, I want this image, but I got one already that has these attributes that you
        told me about it last time you sent it to me.
        The server can then respond with a <code>200</code> meaning it's different content <code>304</code> meaning the
        one you have is the same, so I won't send it again, use the one you got.

        66.1) Can overridden methods return different types? <br>
        - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14694885/8742428">Source on SO</a>. <br>
        - Yes it may differ but there are some limitations.
        Before Java 5.0, when you override a method, both parameters and return type must match exactly. Java 5.0 it
        introduces a new facility called covariant return type. You can override a method with the same signature but
        return a subclass of the object returned.
        In another words, a method in a subclass can return an object whose type is a subclass of the type returned by
        the method with the same signature in the superclass.

    <div class="one-point" id="66.2">
        66.2) Can we override a method by passing subclass of the parameter used in super class method? <br>
        - No, we cannot. <a

        on SO</a>.
        <br>
        - In the below example, you can see that we are trying to override the <i>eat</i> method in the <i>Dog</i> class
        by passing in a subclass of the <i>Food</i> class, <i>Flesh</i>. But the method is NOT overridden. You can test
        this by adding a <code>@Override</code> annotation on top of the <i>eat()</i> method in the <i>Dog</i> class,
        and the compiler will throw an error saying that "Method does not override method from its superclass". <br>
        - So we set out to <i>override</i> methods, but we ended up <i>overloading</i> methods. <br>
        - And hence we get the behavior that we are now showing in the below snippet.

        <div class="code-snippet">

        on SO</a>. Excellent answers. Go through all of them. <br>
        - In the following code snippet, I expect the method selection to take into consideration the real (not the
        declared) parameter type. Hence the expectation is that following code would have printed <i>foo(Object o)</i>,
        <i>foo("foobar")</i>, <i>foo(12)</i>. But instead it prints <i>foo(Object o)</i> three times. What am I missing?
        <br>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/1c8c87fdaddfb2c6c91464e1287f7103.js"></script>
        </div>
        - Your expectation is wrong. In Java, dynamic method dispatch happens only for the
        object the method is called on, not for the parameter types of overloaded methods. <br>
        - Citing the Java Language Specification: When a method is invoked (S15.12), the number of actual arguments (and
        any explicit type arguments) and <i>the compile-time types of the arguments</i> are used, at compile time, to
        determine the signature of the method that will be invoked (S15.12.2). If the method that is to be invoked is an
        instance method, the actual method to be invoked will be determined at run time, using dynamic method lookup
        (S15.12.4). <br>
        - The last statement is a bit confusing. Can you clarify it further. <br>
        - Sure. The compile time type <i>of the method parameters</i> is used to determine the signature of the method
        to be called, in this case <i>foo(Object)</i>. At runtime, <i>the class of the object the method is called
        on</i> determines which implementation of that method is called, taking into account that it may be an instance
        of a subclass of the declared type that overrides the method. <br>
        - Rewriting the above code showing this in action:
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/04c517e914338a24ce4e5c80483db361.js"></script>
        </div>
        - Ability to dispatch a call to a method based on types of arguments is called multiple dispatch. In Java this
        is done with Visitor pattern. However, since you're dealing with Integers and Strings, you cannot easily
        incorporate this pattern (you just cannot modify these classes).
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1572350/8742428">Source on SO</a>. <br>
        - The key to understanding this is that the test for which method or constructor is most specific does
        not use the actual parameters: the parameters appearing in the invocation. They are used only to determine which
        overloadings are applicable. Once the compiler determines which overloadings are applicable and accessible, it
        selects the most specific overloading, using only the formal parameters: the parameters appearing in the
        declaration. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1572499/8742428">Source on SO</a>. <br>

        67) Can an <code>abstract</code> class have a constructor? And if yes, what purpose does it satisfy? <br>
        - Yes, when we define a class to be an Abstract Class it cannot be instantiated but that does not mean an
        Abstract class cannot have a constructor. Each abstract class must have a concrete subclass which will implement
        the abstract methods of that abstract class. <br>
        - When we create an object of any subclass all the constructors in the corresponding inheritance tree are
        invoked in the top to bottom approach. The same case applies to abstract classes. Though we cannot create an
        object of an abstract class, when we create an object of a class which is concrete and subclass of the abstract
        class, the constructor of the abstract class is automatically invoked. Hence we can have a constructor in
        abstract classes.

        - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21204334/system-setproperty-and-system-getproperty">Source on
        SO</a>. <br>
        - <code>System</code> class has a <code>static</code> member variable named <code>props</code> which is of the
        type <code>Properties</code>. <code>Properties</code> extends <code>HashTable</code>. The <code>HashTable</code>
        is defined as <code>Hashtable&lt;Object,Object&gt;</code>. But note that each key and it's corresponding value
        in the property list is a String. So this should answer the first part of your question about <i>where</i> the
        property is saved, like literally. It is stored in a <code>HashTable</code><br>
        - But <i>where</i> is the property stored. You haven't understood how java programs work. When you run a Java
        program, you are actually starting a JVM instance. That instance will have its own System properties. That is
        where you put your property. When you run another program, that will have its own System properties.
        So, you cannot expect a property which you set in one JVM instance to be accessible from another JVM instance!
        <br>
        - When you start a Java process a separate JVM instance is created that runs your process. Also since props is a
        Class variable(not an instance variable) just one copy of it will be present in the corresponding Class instance
        which will be set when that class is loaded. Now this is under the assumption that you do not have any of your
        custom class loaders in which case behavior might be different. But for simplistic scenario you
        System.setProperty() and System.getProperty() will set system properties that you can access via any class
        running as a part of that java process(JVM).

            too late.
            So why is the computation performed in int arithmetic? Because all the factors that are multiplied
            together
            are int values. When you multiply two int values, you get another int value. Java does not have target
            typing,
            a language feature wherein the type of the variable in which a result is to be stored influences the
            type of
            the computation.
            <br>
            It's easy to fix the program by using a long literal in place of an int as the first factor in each
            product.
            This forces all subsequent computations in the expression to be done with long arithmetic.

            When working with large numbers, watch out for overflow - it's a silent killer. Just because a variable
            is
            large enough to hold a result doesn't mean that the computation leading to the result is of the correct
            type.
            <br>
            The rules of promotion in Java are as follows:
            <br>
            Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions. They are as follows: First, all
            byte,
            short, and char values are promoted to int, as just described. Then, if one operand is a long, the whole
            expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float, the entire expression is promoted to float.
            If any of the operands are double, the result is double.

            Always use a capital el (L) in long literals, never a lowercase el (l). Similarly, avoid using a lone el

            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808646/why-are-the-first-four-bytes-of-the-java-class-file-format-cafebabe">The
        tale of 0xcafebabe</a>
        <div>
            The true decimal value of 0xcafebabe is 3,405,691,582 and 0xcafebabea is 54,491,065,322. In binary, they
            can
            be
            represented as follows:
            <br>
            0xcafebabe: 1100 1010 1111 1110 1011 1010 1011 1110 //32bits
            <br>
            0xcafebabea : 1100 1010 1111 1110 1011 1010 1011 1110 1010 //36 bits
            <br>
            But when we try to store it into a long, this happens:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e09ebe16f053dee9b1edaea274423186.js"></script>
            </div>
            This is because 0xcafebabe is stored by default as an int, i.e., 32 bits. Each bit is set separately.
            Representation of 0xcafebabe in 32 bits has its MSB set. Hence JAVA considers it as a negative integer,
            converting it to -889275714.
            <br>
            The same number 0xcafebabe cannot be saved into a long variable if it is converted into its decimal
            representation.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/48ca9de2c3c8ad04b6b86fe0c56a696d.js"></script>
            </div>
            But if instead we do this, then the correct value is stored:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b02e07b5eb58f66af925cd94a1705f47.js"></script>
            </div>
            This is because JAVA saves the number as a 64 bit number. The MSB is not set and hence you can represent
            the true value of the number.
            <br>
            Now what happens if we try to store a 36 bit number - 0xcafebabea? The number clearly cannot fit into an
            int
            and hence we now get a compile error on line 1 (unlike the previous case where 0xcafebabe could fit into
            32
            bits
            and hence we did not get any kind of error). Casting the number into a long is also not going to help
            (as we
            discussed
            in the previous point - already too late by this point) and also seen on line 2. Hence, the correct way
            to
            store the number is to declare it as a
            long as shown in line 3.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/362d9fcdd556f3fc8b72e158b69b4973.js"></script>
            </div>
            In conclusion:
            To write a negative decimal constant, you use the unary negation operator (-) in combination with a
            decimal
            literal.
            In this way, you can write any int or long value, whether positive or negative, in decimal form, and
            negative decimal constants are clearly identifiable by the presence of a minus sign. Not so for
            hexadecimal
            and octal literals. They can take on both positive and negative values. Hex and octal literals are
            negative
            if their high-order bit is set.
            <br>
            0xcafebabe: 1100 1010 1111 1110 1011 1010 1011 1110 //32bits
            <br>
            So when you do this:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e09ebe16f053dee9b1edaea274423186.js"></script>
            </div>
            Highest order bit is set. So before storing into the long x variable, as per the 2s complement, the
            complement of the binary number is taken and then 1 is added to that number and then - is appended to it
            giving
            you the final value of -889275714.

            0xcafebabe is stored as an int. As described above,
            <br>

            <br>
            The problem is caused due to the sign-extension of the int datatype. We declare 0xcafebabe as
            0xcafebabeL
            (line 2)
            and the problem is solved.

        5) What will this output:

            Two's complement representation of -1 is: 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 i.e. all bits are set.
            <br>
            Size of a byte is 8 bits. Casting int into a byte takes the 8 bits starting from the LSB. This will be a
            narrowing operation. byte is a signed datatype. Hence 1111 1111 still represents -1 in byte.
            <br>
            Next step: (char) 1111 1111. Now this is a widening operation to 16 bits. char is an unsigned datatype.
            For
            widening
            operations we have the following rule:
            <br>
            The sign extension behavior when converting from narrower integral types to wider: Sign extension is
            performed
            if the type of the original value is signed; zero extension if it is a char, regardless of the type to
            which it is being converted.
            <br>
            byte is a narrower signed integral type that we are widening by converting to char. So sign extension
            will
            be performed.
            <br>
            (char) (byte) -1 // 1111 1111 1111 1111 = 2^16 - 1 = 65535 (because char is unsigned)
            <br>
            Next step: (int) 1111 1111 1111 1111. Now this is a widening operation. The rule we stated above tells
            us
            that
            since we are widening from a char, we will zero extend the number. Hence the final value becomes:
            <br>
            0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1111 1111 1111 //= 65535
            <br>
            What should you do in case you are widening from a char to an int and you want the sign extension to be
            performed?
            <br>
            Cast the char to a short, which is the same width as a char but signed.
            <br>
            What should you do in case you are widening from a byte value b to a char but do not want the sign
            extension
            to
            be performed?
            <br>
            Use a bit mask to suppress the sign extension.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/38f5fb1734b3f2c6486545a6268ed316.js"></script>
            </div>
            b will be promoted to an int (32 bits) for the & operation. In accordance with the widening rule stated
            above
            sign extension will be performed on the byte b. The & operation with 0xff will keep only the right most
            8
            bits,
            changing all the other 24 bits to 0. Now when this is cast into a char it will be a narrowing operation
            that keeps only the rightmost 16 bits and thus we have a way to convert a narrower integral signed type
            to a wider type without sign extension.

            x += i is not a shorthand for x = x + i. The Java language specification says that the compound
            assignment
            E1 op= E2 is equivalent to the simple assignment E1 = (T) ((E1) op (E2)), where T is the type of E1,
            except that E1 is evaluated only once. In the above code, this would mean that x += i would evaluate to:
            x = (char) (x + i)
            <br>
            x is of type short but i of type int. Hence x will be extended to 32 bits. The two numbers will be added
            to give the result 123456, whose binary representation is:
            <br>
            0001 1110 0010 0100 0000.
            The cast into short will lob off everything except the rightmost 16 bits. Hence x = 1110 0010 0100 0000
            which in 2's complement becomes -7616.
            <br>
            In other words, compound assignment expressions automatically cast the result of the computation they
            perform to the type of the variable on their left-hand side. If the type of the result is identical to
            the type of the variable, the cast has no effect. If, however, the type of the result computed after
            performing the operations on the right hand side is wider than
            that of the variable, the compound assignment operator performs a silent narrowing primitive conversion
            [JLS 5.1.3]. Attempting to perform the equivalent simple assignment would generate a compilation error,
            with good reason.
            <br>
            The corresponding simple assignment on line 3 does not work because you are trying to assign an int
            value
            into a short variable which is not possible without using an explicit cast.

            The compiler evaluates the constant expression 'H' + 'a' by promoting each of the char-valued operands
            ('H'
            and 'a')
            to int values through a process known as widening primitive conversion. Widening primitive conversion of
            a char to an int zero extends the 16-bit char value to fill the 32-bit int. In the case of 'H', the char
            value is 72 and in the case of 'a', it is 97, so the expression 'H' + 'a' is equivalent to the int
            constant
            72 + 97, or 169.
            <br>
            The + operator performs string concatenation if and only if at least one of its operands is of type
            String;
            otherwise, it performs addition. If none of the values to be concatenated are strings, you have
            several choices: prepend the empty string; convert the first value to a string explicitly, using
            String.valueOf;
            use a string buffer; or if you are using release 5.0, use the printf facility.

            First, understand that although char are represented as integers, many libraries treat it differently.
            For example, when you print a char it is printed as the Unicode character and not the integer.
            <br>
            String conversion for object references, which include arrays, is defined as follows: If the reference
            is
            null,
            it is converted to the string "null". Otherwise, the conversion is performed as if by an invocation of
            the toString method of the referenced object with no arguments; but if the result of invoking the
            toString
            method is null, then the string "null" is used instead. (??)
            Arrays inherit the toString method from Object, whose specification says, "Returns a string consisting
            of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character '@', and the
            unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object"

            You should by this point probably know that pig == dog will return false. The == operator, does not test
            whether two objects are equal; it tests whether two object references are identical. Which in this case,
            they are not.
            But the output in this case is: false. Yes. Not "Animals are equal: false". But just "false". Why
            though?
            <br>
            The + operator, whether used for addition or string concatenation, binds more tightly than the ==
            operator.
            Therefore, the parameter of the println method is evaluated like this:
            <br>
            System.out.println(("Animals are equal: " + pig) == dog);
            <br>
            The value of the boolean expression is, of course, false, and that is exactly what the program prints.
            There is one surefire way to avoid this sort of difficulty: When using the string concatenation
            operator,
            always parenthesize nontrivial operands.

            The backslash is used as a marker character to tell the compiler/interpreter that the next character has
            some
            special meaning. What that next character means is up to the implementation. For example C-style
            languages
            use \n to mean newline and \t to mean tab. The use of the word "escape" really means to temporarily
            escape
            out of parsing the text and into a another mode where the subsequent character is treated differently.
            Any quote (") that is preceded by a slash (\") is escaped, and understood to be part of the value of the
            string.

        13) So what does it mean to escape in regex?
        <div>
            Many characters in regular expressions have special meanings. For instance, the dot character '.' means
            "any one character". There are a great deal of these specially-defined characters, and sometimes, you
            want
            to search for one, not use it's special meaning. (<a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37064290/what-does-escape-a-string-mean-in-regex-javascript">Source</a>)
            <br>
            From MSDN:
            <br>
            The character that follows it is a special character, as shown in the table in the following section.
            For example, \b is an anchor that indicates that a regular expression match should begin on a word
            boundary,
            \t represents a tab, and \x020 represents a space.
            A character that otherwise would be interpreted as an unescaped language construct should be interpreted
            literally.
            For example, a brace ({) begins the definition of a quantifier, but a backslash followed by a brace (\{)
            indicates that the regular expression engine should match the brace. Similarly, a single backslash marks
            the beginning of an escaped language construct, but two backslashes (\\) indicate that the regular
            expression
            engine should match the backslash.

            The key to understanding this puzzle is that Java provides no special treatment for Unicode escapes
            within
            string literals. The compiler translates Unicode escapes into the characters they represent before it
            parses
            the program into tokens, such as strings literals [JLS 3.2]. Therefore, the first Unicode escape in the
            program
            closes a one-character string literal ("a"), and the second one opens a one-character string literal
            ("b").
            The program prints the value of the expression: "a".length() + "b".length(), or 2.
            The third example prints 16 because you are escaping the quotation with a backslash.
            <br>
            Unicode escapes are designed for use when a programmer needs to insert a character that can't be
            represented
            in the source file's character set. They are used primarily to put non-ASCII characters into
            identifiers,
            string literals, character literals, and comments. Occasionally, a Unicode escape adds to the clarity of
            a program by positively identifying one of several similar-looking characters.

                This program isn't even guaranteed to terminate normally, much less to print any particular
                sequence.
                Its behavior is completely unspecified. The culprit here is the String(byte[]) constructor. Its
                specification says:
                "Constructs a new String by decoding the specified byte array using the platform's default charset.
                The length of the new String is a function of the charset, and hence may not be equal to the length
                of the byte array. The behavior of this constructor when the given bytes are not valid in the
                default
                charset is unspecified"
                <br>
                What exactly is a charset? Technically, it is "the combination of a coded character set and a
                character-encoding scheme" [Java-API]. In other words, a charset is a bunch of characters, the
                numerical codes that represent them, and a way to translate back and forth between a sequence of
                character codes and a sequence of bytes. The translation scheme differs greatly among charsets. Some
                have a one-to-one mapping between characters and bytes; most do not.
                <br>
                If you want to know your JRE's default charset and you are using release 5.0 or a later release, you
                can find out by invoking:
                <br>
                System.out.println(java.nio.charset.Charset.defaultCharset()); // Prints UTF-8
                <br>
                When translating between char sequences and byte sequences, you can and usually should specify a
                charset
                explicitly.
                The lesson of this puzzle is that every time you translate a byte sequence to a String, you are
                using
                a charset, whether you specify it explicitly or not. If you want your program to behave predictably,
                specify a charset each time you use one.

            a) rnd.nextInt(2) generates numbers exclusive of 2. So the numbers generated are: {0,1}. Hence case2 is
            never triggered.
            The specification for Random.nextInt(int) says: "Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value
            between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive). Whenever you are working with lengths,
            ranges,
            or moduli, be careful to determine which endpoints should be included, and make sure that your code
            behaves accordingly.

            c) StringBuffer(int capacity); takes as an argument an integer that specifies the capacity of the
            buffer.
            By using a character, you are implicitly converting it into an int by widening. Which as you might have

            is not such a great idea.

            The problem is that String.replaceAll takes a regular expression as its first parameter, not a literal
            sequence of characters.
            (Regular expressions were added to the Java platform in release 1.4.) The regular expression "." matches
            any
            single character, and so every character of the class name is replaced by a slash, producing the output
            we
            saw.
            To match only the period character, the period in the regular expression must be escaped by preceding it
            with a backslash (\). Because the backslash character has special meaning in a string literal-it begins
            an escape sequence - the backslash itself must be escaped with a second backslash. This produces an
            escape
            sequence that generates a backslash in the string literal.
            <br>
            System.out.println(Me.class.getName().replaceAll("\\.", "/") + ".class");
            <br>
            This prints: com/company/Chapter3/com/javapuzzlers/Me.class
            <br>
            Which is what we wanted.
            <br>
            Another problem with this program is that the correct behavior is platform dependent. Not all file
            systems use the slash character to separate hierarchical filename components. To get a valid filename
            for the platform on which you are running, you should use the correct platform-dependent separator
            character in place of the slash.

            0x90 is: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001 0000 which is equal to +144

            When placed after a variable, the ++ operator functions as the postfix increment operator [JLS 15.14.2]:
            The value of the expression j++ is the original value of j before it was incremented. Therefore, the
            preceding assignment first saves the value of j, then sets j to its value plus 1, and, finally, resets j

            If you need a loop that iterates near the boundaries of the int values, you are better off using a long

            The constant -1 is the int value with all 32 bits set (0xffffffff). The left-shift operator shifts
            zeroes
            in from the right to fill the low-order bits vacated by the shift, so the expression (-1 << i) has its
            rightmost i bits set to 0 and the remaining 32 - i bits set to 1. The problem is that (-1 << 32) is
            equal
            to -1 rather than 0, because shift operators use only the five low-order bits of their right operand as
            the shift distance, or six bits if the left operand is a long [JLS 15.19].
            <br>
            This applies to all three shift operators: <<, >>, and >>>. The shift distance is always between 0 and
            31,
            or 0 and 63 if the left operand is a long. (This means that whatever shift count you pass, it will be
            interpreted modulo 32. Attempting to shift by 32 on such platform will actually shift by 0, i.e.
            not shift at all.) It is calculated mod 32, or mod 64 if the left operand is a long. Attempting to shift
            an int value 32 bits or a long value 64 bits just returns the value itself. There is no shift distance
            that discards all 32 bits of an int value or all 64 bits of a long value.
            <br>
            Another important point is that the left-shift operator with a -ve shift does not act as a right shift
            operator.
            A right shift always functions as a right shift, and a left shift always functions as a left shift.
            Negative shift distances are made positive by lopping off all but the five low order bits-six bits if

            <br>
            -63 => 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1100 0001
            <br>
            Since s is an int, we will use the rightmost 5 bits for shifting => 0 0001 = 1. Hence the shift s = s >>
            -63
            is actually equivalent to s = s >> 1 which gives us s = 4, and which is the output in the example above.

        22) What will make these loops run indefinitely?
        <div>
            a) Provide a declaration for i that turns this loop into an infinite loop:

            Java mandates the use of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic [IEEE-754], which lets you represent
            infinity
            as a double or float. As we learned in school, infinity plus 1 is still infinity. If i is initialized to
            infinity before the loop starts, the termination test (i == i + 1) evaluates to true, and the loop never
            terminates.
            <br>
            So, the next question is, how do you initialize something to infinity?
            <br>
            There are few ways:
            <div class="code-snippet">

            The distance between adjacent floating-point values is called an ulp, which is an acronym for unit in
            the
            last place.
            In release 5.0, the Math.ulp method was introduced to calculate the ulp of a float or double value.
            Floating-point operations return the floating-point value that is closest to their exact mathematical
            result.
            Once the distance between adjacent floating-point values is greater than 2, adding 1 to a floating-point
            value will have no effect, because the half-way point between values won't be reached. For the float
            type,
            the least magnitude beyond which adding 1 will have no effect is 2^25, or 33,554,432; for the double
            type,
            it is 2^54, or approximately 1.8 × 10^16.

                IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic reserves a special value to represent a quantity that is not a
                number
                [IEEE-754].
                This value, known as NaN (short for "Not a Number"), is the value of all floating-point computations
                that do
                not have well-defined numeric values, such as 0.0 / 0.0. The specification says that NaN is not
                equal to
                any floating-point value, including itself. Therefore, if i is initialized to NaN before the loop
                starts,
                the termination test (i != i) evaluates to true, and the loop never terminates. Strange but true.

                The thing to remember over here is that + is an overloaded operator. When the arguments to + are
                Strings,
                the + operator ends up concatenating the strings. If one operand in the concatenation is of some
                type
                other than String, that operand is converted to a string prior to concatenation.

                The key to solving this puzzle is that >>>= is a compound assignment operator. Suppose that you
                precede
                the loop with the following
                declaration:
                <br>
                short i = -1;
                <br>
                Because the initial value of i ((short)0xffff) is nonzero, the body of the
                loop is executed. The first step in the execution of the shift operation is that the
                value of i is promoted to an int. All arithmetic operations do this to operands of
                type short, byte, or char. This promotion is a widening primitive conversion, so
                no information is lost. This promotion performs sign extension, so the resulting
                int value is 0xffffffff. This value is then shifted to the right by one bit without
                sign extension to yield the int value 0x7fffffff. Finally, this value is stored
                back into i. In order to store the int value into the short variable, Java performs
                the dreaded narrowing primitive conversion, which simply lops off the high-order
                16 bits of the value. This leaves (short)0xffff, and we are back where we
                started. The second and successive iterations of the loop behave identically, so the
                loop never terminates.
                <br>
                Similar behavior occurs if you declare i to be a short or byte variable initialized to any negative
                value.
                You will not get an infinite loop if you declare i to be a
                char, as char values are unsigned, so the widening primitive conversion that
                occurs prior to the shift doesn't perform sign extension.
                <br>
                <em>In summary, do not use compound assignment operators on short, byte, or char variables. </em>
                <br>
                Such expressions perform mixed-type arithmetic, which can be confusing in and of itself. Far worse,
                they
                perform an implicit narrowing cast, which can discard information.

                e) Provide declarations for i and j that turn this loop into an infinite loop:
                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/5bfb9d9c0cdf4eac83c2477599606137.js"></script>

                Until release 5.0, Java's numerical comparison operators (<, <=, >, and >=) required both of their
                operands to be of a primitive numeric type (byte, char, short, int, long, float, or double) [JLS2
                15.20.1].
                In release 5.0, the specification was changed to say that the type of each operand must be
                convertible
                to a primitive numeric type [JLS 15.20.1, 5.1.8].
                <br>
                Check <a
                    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18804599/why-does-i-j-j-i-i-j-evaluate-to-true/18804642">this
                link</a> for details.
                <br>
                The first two subexpressions (i <= j and j <= i) perform unboxing conversions [JLS 5.1.8] on i and j
                and compare the resulting int values numerically. Both i and j represent 0, so both of these
                subexpressions
                evaluate to true. The third subexpression (i != j) performs an identity comparison on the object
                references
                i and j. The two variables refer to distinct objects, as each was initialized to a new Integer
                instance.
                Therefore, the third subexpression also evaluates to true, and the loop spins forever.
                The equality operators do perform numerical comparison when only one of their two operands is of a
                boxed numeric type and the other is of a primitive type.
                <br>
                The <= operator is still antisymmetric on the set of primitive numeric values, but now it applies to
                operands of boxed numeric types as well. (The boxed numeric types are Byte, Character, Short,
                Integer,
                Long, Float, and Double). The <= operator is not antisymmetric on operands of these types, because
                Java's
                equality operators (== and !=) perform reference identity comparison rather than value comparison
                when
                applied to object references.

                In the boolean expression (i == -i && i != 0), the unary minus operator is applied to i, which
                implies
                that its type must be numeric: It is illegal to apply the unary minus operator to a non-numeric
                operand.
                Therefore, we are looking for a nonzero numeric value that is equal to its own negation.
                NaN does not satisfy this property, as it is not equal to any value, so i must represent an actual
                number.
                No floating-point value other than 0 is equal to itself with the sign bit flipped, so the type of i
                must
                be integral.
                <br>
                There is, however, a corresponding disadvantage. There exist an even number of int values-2^32 to be
                precise-and one of these values is used to represent 0. That leaves an odd number of int values to
                represent positive and negative integers, which means that there must be a different number of
                positive
                and negative int values. This in turn implies that there is at least one int value whose negation
                cannot be correctly represented as an int value.
                <br>
                In fact, there is exactly one such int value, and it is Integer.MIN_VALUE, or -2^31 =
                -2,147,483,648.
                <br>
                -2,147,483,648 = 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
                <br>
                Negating this means inverting all of the bits and adding 1 to the value. Which would give the same
                bit
                sequence as the answer.
                <br>
                In other words, Integer.MIN_VALUE is its own negation, as is Long.MIN_VALUE.
                <br>
                Therefore, the declaration of i as:
                <br>
                int i = Integer.MIN_VALUE; //or
                <br>
                long i = Long.MIN_VALUE;
                <br>
                will cause the above code to loop indefinitely.

            The initial value of f is close to Integer.MAX_VALUE, so it requires 31 bits to express precisely, and
            the float type provides only 24 bits of precision. Incrementing such a large float value will not change
            it.
            The problem is that the termination test fails in much the same way that the increment does. The loop
            runs
            only so long as the loop index f is less than (float)(START + 50). The promotion from int to float is
            performed automatically when comparing an int to a float. Unfortunately, this promotion is one of the
            three widening primitive conversions that can result in loss of precision [JLS 5.1.2].
            (The others are long to float and long to double.)
            <br>
            The initial value of f is so large that adding 50 to it and converting the result to a float produces
            the same value as simply converting f to a float. In other words, (float)2000000000 == 2000000050,
            so the expression f < START + 50 is false before the loop body has executed even once, and the loop body
            never gets a chance to run.

            Fixing this program is as simple as changing the type of the loop variable from a float to an int.
            <br>
            The moral of this puzzle is simple: Do not use floating-point loop indices, because it can lead to
            unpredictable behavior.
            If you need a floating-point value in the body of a loop, take the int or long loop index and convert it
            to a float or double. You may lose precision when converting an int or long to a float or a long to a
            double,
            but at least it will not affect the loop itself. When you use floating-point, use double rather than
            float
            unless you are certain that float provides enough precision and you have a compelling performance need
            to
            use float.
            <br>
            For a variation on the above, note that although g == (g + 50), g != (g + 100). So if we changed our
            above
            program
            to have the loop check changed to: f < START + 100, the program turns into an infinite loop. This is
            because
            now f++ (increment of f by 1) leads to the same value as f.

            The problem lies in the boolean expression (ms % 60*1000 == 0). You might think that this expression is
            equivalent to (ms % 60000 == 0), but it isn't. The remainder and multiplication operators have the same
            precedence [JLS 15.17], so the expression ms % 60*1000 is equivalent to (ms % 60) * 1000.
            This expression is equal to 0 if (ms % 60) is 0, so the loop increments minutes every 60 iterations.
            This accounts for the final result being off by a factor of a thousand.

            first.
            For example, 1 + 2 * 3 is treated as 1 + (2 * 3), whereas 1 * 2 + 3 is treated as (1 * 2) + 3 since
            multiplication
            has a higher precedence than addition.
            Associativity: When an expression has two operators with the same precedence, the expression is
            evaluated
            according to its associativity.
            <br>
            For example x = y = z = 17 is treated as x = (y = (z = 17)), leaving all three variables with the value
            17,
            since the = operator has right-to-left associativity (and an assignment statement evaluates to the value
            on
            the right hand side).
            On the other hand, 72 / 2 / 3 is treated as (72 / 2) / 3 since the / operator has left-to-right
            associativity.
            Some operators are not associative: for example, the expressions (x <= y <= z) and x++-- are invalid.
