      You cannot pass <code>int</code> by reference in Java. Wrapping an <code>int</code> into an

      because <code>Integer</code> is immutable. What you can do is store the integer in an <code>int[]</code>

    5) Why do we get one extra negative number?
    <div>
      When representing a number in 32 bits, the highest bit is used as a sign bit, so when representing a number
      like 2147483647 in binary, it is 01111...111 (31 bits that are 1's).
      <br>
      When we add one more to that we get:
      <br>
      10000...000 (31 0's)
      However, because of a need to avoid representing 0 twice (once as 00..0 and other time as 100..0), we wrap
      the number, so instead of 100..0 representing -0, this represents negative 2147483648 (not negative
      2147483647
      because the positive side needed to represent 0, but as the negative side doesn't, we get one "extra"
      negative number).

    7) Is Java pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?
    <div>
      Strictly speaking, for references it's "pass reference by value" and for primitives it's just "pass by
      value" -
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3330864/how-can-i-pass-an-integer-class-correctly-by-reference">Source</a>
      <br>
      (From Java: The Complete Reference)
      <br>
      Although Java uses call-by-value to pass all arguments, the precise effect differs between whether a
      primitive
      type or a reference type is passed.
      <br>
      When you pass a primitive type to a method, it is passed by value. Thus, a copy of the argument is made, and
      what occurs to the parameter that receives the argument has no effect outside the method.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/34c8ceae9366e91b9750e57e5686f1cf.js"></script>
        </div>
      </div>

      When you pass an object to a method, the situation changes dramatically, because objects are passed by what
      is effectively call-by-reference. Keep in mind that when you create a variable of a class type, you are only
      creating a reference to an object. Thus, when you pass this reference to a method, the parameter that
      receives it will refer to the same object as that referred to by the argument. This effectively means that
      objects act as if they are passed to methods by use of call-by-reference. Changes to the object inside the
      method do affect the object used as an argument.
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
      Remember: When an object reference is passed to a method, the reference itself is passed by use of
      call-by-value. However, since the value being passed refers to an object, the copy of that value will still
      refer to the same object that its corresponding argument does.

    10) What is the difference between a "class method" and an "instance method"?
    <div>
      Instance methods use an instance of a class, whereas a class method can be used with just the class name.
      A class method is called a "static" method in many languages. Accessors (Getters and Setters) are instance
      methods
      because they are setting and getting the state of a specific instance.
      <br>
      Along the same lines, you also have "class variables", "instance variables", and "local variables"
      <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">Local variable</p>: is declared inside a method/constructor or within a block (enclosed in braces) and
      must be
      initialized before use, otherwise it won't compile.
      <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">Instance variable</p>: is declared inside a class. It's initialization is not compulsory. If omitted, it
      contains default value (0, 0.0, false, null, etc.). Every instance of that class (object) has it's own copy
      of that variable. Changes made to the variable don't reflect in other instances of that class.
      <br>
      <p class="inline-heading">Class variables</p>: These are also known as static member variables and there's only one copy of that
      variable
      that is shared with all instances of that class. If changes are made to that variable, all other instances
      will see the effect of the changes.

    23) What is the point of "final class" in Java? <br>
    - In Java, items with the <code>final</code> modifier cannot be changed. This includes final classes, final
    variables, and final methods. A final class cannot be extended by any other class. A final variable cannot be
    reassigned another value. A final method cannot be overridden. <br>
    - A <code>final</code> class is simply a class that can't be extended. It does not mean that all references to
    objects of the class would act as if they were declared as <code>final</code>.
  </div>

  <div class="one-point">
    59) Why are methods declared <code>final</code>? <br>
    - You can declare some or all of a class's methods <code>final</code>. You use the <code>final</code> keyword in
    a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. <br>
    - You might wish to make a method <code>final</code> if it has an implementation that should not be changed and
    it is critical to the consistent state of the object. <br>
    - Methods called from constructors should generally be declared <code>final</code>. If a constructor calls a
    non-final method, a subclass may redefine that method with surprising or undesirable results. <br>
    - Note that you can also declare an entire class <code>final</code>. A class that is declared <code>final</code>
    cannot be subclassed. This is particularly useful, for example, when creating an immutable class like the String
    class. <br>

    61) Why can final object be modified? <br>
    - If a final variable holds a reference to an object, then the state of the object may be changed by operations
    on the object, but the variable will always refer to the same object. <code>final</code> simply makes the object
    <i>reference</i> unchangeable. The object it points to is not immutable by doing this. <a

    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42477229/8742428">When to use Preorder, Postorder, and Inorder Binary Search Tree Traversal strategies</a> <br>
    - There are two general techniques to traversing a tree: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/solution/">LC Solution</a><br>
    a) BFS: We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be visited before the ones with lower
    levels. <br>
    b) DFS: In this strategy, we adopt the depth as the priority, so that one would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf, and then back to root to reach
    another branch. The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as preorder, inorder, and postorder depending on the relative order among the root node, left node and right
    node. <br>
    - <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/solution/">Binary Tree Pre Order Traversal</a>. (From LeetCode solutions) Taking pre-order traversal
    as an example, in each iteration, we pop one node from the stack and visit this node. Then if this node has a right child, push its right child into the stack. If this node
    has a left child, push its left child into the stack. It is noteworthy that we push the right child first so that we can visit the left child first since the nature of the
    stack is LIFO(last in first out). After that, we can continue to the next iteration until the stack is empty. <br>
    - <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/">Binary Tree In Order Traversal</a> (Traversal using iterative approach)<br>
    - <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/">Binary Tree Post Order Traversal</a>. Lot of confusion on this one in the comment section about
    reversing the order or something. Refer <a
    href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/discuss/45582/A-real-Postorder-Traversal-.without-reverse-or-insert-4ms">this solution</a> to see a
    way to do it without having to reverse the list. The explanation of what is going on is present in the comments: The algorithm is that we push each node twice onto the
    stack. Each time we pop a node out, if we see that there is a same node on the stack, we know that we have not done traversing yet, and need to keep pushing the current
    node's children onto the stack. However, if the stack is empty, or the top element is not the same as the current element, we know that we're done searching with this node,
    thus we can add this node to the result. <br>

    35) Write about the different ways you can use the <code>split</code> method in Strings <br>
    - The <i>limit</i> parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied and therefore affects the length of the resulting array. If the <i>limit</i> is positive
    then the pattern will be applied at most <i>limit-1</i> times, the array's length will be no greater than <i>limit</i>, and the array's last entry will contain all input
    beyond the last matched delimiter. <br>
    - The method signature is as follows: <code>public String[] split(String regex, int limit)</code> <br>
    - The string "boo:and:foo", for example, yields the following results with these parameters: <br>
    Regex Limit Result with separator as ":" <br>
    2 (Limit args passed in){ "boo", "and:foo" } <br>
    5 (Limit args passed in){ "boo", "and", "foo" } <br>
    -2 (Limit args passed in) { "boo", "and", "foo" } <br>
    Regex Limit Result with separator as "o" <br>
    5 (Limit args passed in) { "b", "", ":and:f", "", "" } <br>

    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55141359/8742428">Explanation of ConcurrentModificationException</a> on SO. <br>
    - You are able to add and remove elements from a list while you are iterating over the same list if you are using a for-i type loop. <br>
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

    </div>
    - But if you are using a for-each style loop, adding and removing elements while you are iterating over them will throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>.
    <div class="code-block">

    - A <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> is thrown when you try to modify a <code>Collection</code> while iterating over it and without using the method
    <code>remove</code> of the iterator. When you use the syntax <code>for (Integer i : list2)</code>, an iterator is created for you. If you like to delete items from your
    code you explicitly needs to iterate over an iterator or you need to loop using the old style for loop. Or you can use an <code>Iterator</code>. But remember that by using
    an iterator, you can only remove elements from the list while you are iterating over the same list. You cannot add elements to the list. <a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34827336/8742428">Source on SO</a>. <br>
    - But the question is, do you <i>really</i> want to modify the list while you are also iterating over it? Consider the following scenario.

    - So, back to our original question, how do you remove an element from a list while iterating over the same list? Use the <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#removeIf-java.util.function.Predicate-"><code>removeIf</code></a> method introduced in Java 8.
    <br>
    - Alternatively, you can use the for-i loop and traverse the list backwards to remove the required element as shown <a

    38.3) Adding and removing from a <code>Set</code>/<code>Map</code> while iterating over the same set/map <br>
    - You cannot add or remove elements from a Set/Map while iterating over it using the enhanced for loop.

    - In order to remove elements from a <code>Set</code>/<code>Map</code>, similar to the case of <code>List</code>, you can use the <code>removeIf</code> method. <br>
    - Note in the below example that the way that the <code>removeIf</code> method is being called on a <code>Set</code> is different from the way that it is being called on
    the <code>Map</code>. Also note the way that you iterate over a <code>Map</code> using the <code>forEach</code> method. You are doing
    <code>map.forEach((key, value) -> {System.out.println(key + ", " + value)})</code> and not
    <code>map.forEach(entry -> {System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ", " + entry.getValue())})</code>

    - Note: there are a total of three ways that you can use the <code>removeIf</code> method to remove elements from a <code>Map</code>. <a
    href="https://lankydan.dev/2019/03/03/removing-elements-from-a-map-in-java">Source</a>. <code>removeIf</code> is a method available to <code>Collections</code>. A
    <code>Map</code> itself is not a <code>Collection</code> and does not have access to <code>removeIf</code> itself. But, by using: <code>values</code>, <code>keySet</code>
    or <code>entrySet</code>, a view of the Map's contents is returned. This view implements <code>Collection</code> allowing <code>removeIf</code> to be called on it. The
    <code>Collection</code> returned by <code>values</code> is backed by the <code>Map</code> and that changing either the <code>Collection</code> or the <code>Map</code> will
    alter the other. <code>keySet</code> and <code>entrySet</code> are also both backed by the Map's contents.<br>

    <br>
    <br>

    - First, let us take a look at the <code>Comparable</code> interface itself:
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

      </div>
    </div>
    - Note that the interface is making use of Generics. The type parameter that is passed into the interface name here in <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code> is the same type
    parameter that is being expected to be passed in as the args to the <code>compareTo(T o)</code> method. Read the comment to <a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/64901718/8742428">this answer on SO</a> to understand that. <br>
    - So what this means is that you can make a class implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface in the following ways: <br>
    a) You implement <code>Comparable&lt;ComparablePerson&gt;</code>
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

      </div>
    </div>

    b) You implement <code>Comparable&lt;Person&gt;</code>
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="code-snippet">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/815e886399500707c007b07b6f5831ec.js"></script>
      </div>
    </div>

    c) You implement <code>Comparable</code>
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

      </div>
    </div>

    - All of the above 3 will compile and order the <i>ComparablePerson</i> class as intended. Point that we are trying to note over here is that the same type parameter that
    is used in interface definition is also used in the <code>compareTo</code> method. Depending on the type that you use for the <code>Comparable</code>, you can only use it
    with the appropriate type of object. <code>Comparable&lt;ComparablePerson&gt;</code> can be compared only with another <i>ComparablePerson</i>,
    <code>Comparable&lt;Person&gt;</code> will be able to be compared with other <i>Person</i> types, and if you use <code>Comparable&lt;Object&gt;</code>, you can compare all
    <code>Object</code> types with it.

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="inline-heading">What is <code>Comparable</code> interface</p>? <br>
    - Read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3718478/8742428">this SO Answer to understand this</a>. <br>
    - Comparable defines a 'natural ordering'. What this means is that you're defining it when one object should be considered "less than" or "greater than". Things like
    <code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> already have a 'natural ordering' associated with them. For example, you can sort strings lexicographically by calling
    <code>Collections.sort()</code> and the strings will be sorted for you. Same for Integers as well. All sorting methods in JDK will use this natural ordering by default.<br>
    - But what happens in the case of custom objects that you create? For example, the <i>ComparablePerson</i> object that we created above. If we need to sort a list of
    <i>ComparablePerson</i> objects, we need to specify a natural ordering to the objects, just like the <code>String</code> class or the <code>Integer</code> class. This is
    done by implementing the <code>Comparable</code> interface <i>inside</i> the class. Which is what we are doing in the above examples. <br>
    - Note that you can do the equivalent thing by defining a <code>Comparator</code>. The difference is that the <code>Comparator</code> defines the ordering logic <i>outside
    the object</i>. Maybe in a separate process I need to order the same objects by <i>name</i> and not <i>id</i> - in that case the ordering isn't necessarily a property of
    the object, or differs from the objects natural ordering. In that case, could use an external <code>Comparator</code>. This is just like sorting a list of strings by the
    length of the string, instead of sorting them lexically. <br>
    - The point is that the logic has to exist somewhere. That can be: <br>
    i) in the object itself, if it's naturally comparable (implements Comparable -e.g. integers) <br>
    ii) supplied in an external comparator, as in the example above.

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="inline-heading">Some key facts to remember while you are overriding <code>compareTo</code>:</p> (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37720126/8742428">Source on
    SO</a>)<br>
    i) CompareTo must be in consistent with equals method e.g. if two objects are equal via equals() , there compareTo() must return zero otherwise if those objects are stored
    in SortedSet or SortedMap they will not behave properly. <br>
    ii) CompareTo() must throw NullPointerException if current object get compared to null object as opposed to equals() which return false on such scenario. <br>

    43.1) How does the Deque implementation differ between LinkedList and ArrayDeque? <br>
    - The difference lies between how each of the DS implementations handle null values. When the <code>Deque</code> interface uses the <code>LinkedList</code> implementation,
    you are allowed to add null values to the <code>Deque</code>. But if you use a <code>ArrayDeque</code> implementation, adding null values to the <code>Deque</code> is going
    to throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> <br>
    - There was also the confusion that if you are using the <code>ArrayDeque</code> as a stack, and doing a <code>push</code> operation on it, does it shift the remaining
    element in the stack to the right? So would that mean that using a <code>LinkedList</code> implementation in this case be better then? No. As mentioned in the
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html">javadoc here</a>, most ArrayDeque operations run in amortized constant time. Exceptions
    include remove, removeFirstOccurrence, removeLastOccurrence, contains, iterator.remove(), and the bulk operations, all of which run in linear time. So you should continue
    to use <code>ArrayDeque</code> implementations when using it as a stack as well (<a

    43.2) <code>TreeSet</code> vs <code>PriorityQueue</code>? Finding k maximum elements in a collection. <br>

    - The <code>PriorityQueue</code> docs on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html">Oracle Java here</a> states the runtime of the
    <code>PriorityQueue</code> operations as follows: <br>
    a) this implementation provides O(log(n)) time for the enqueing and dequeing methods (offer, poll, remove() and add()); linear time for the remove(Object) and
    contains(Object) methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods (peek(), element(), and size()). <br>
    - [element() is just another version of peek(). A collection designed
    for holding elements prior to processing. Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations. Each of these
    methods exists in two forms: one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation). <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html">Source on Queue docs on Oracle Java</a>] <br>
    - Note that the <code>TreeSet</code> interface that is an implementation of the <code>Set</code> interface has additional methods that are not present in the
    <code>Set</code> interface and that are useful. <br>
    - Time Complexity of the <code>TreeSet</code> methods are mentioned in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14379571/8742428">this SO Post</a>. <br>
    a) Operations which work on a single element are all O(ln n) comparisons except first and last which are O(1) comparisons or O(ln N) node search time. <br>
    b) comparator(), iterator(), clear(), first(), isEMpty(), size(), last(), pollFirst(), pollLast() are O(1) <br>
    c) add(), ceiling(), contains(), floor(), headSet(), higher(), lower(), remove(), subSet(), tailSet() are O(ln N) <br>
    d) clone(), equals(), hashCode(), toArray() and toString() are O(n) <br>
    - From Oracle Java Docs: <code>TreeSet</code> implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains). (<a

    - <a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2190161/difference-between-java-lang-runtimeexception-and-java-lang-exception">In
    Java, there are two types of exceptions</a>: checked exceptions and un-checked exceptions. A checked exception
    must be handled explicitly by the code, whereas, an un-checked exception does not need to be explicitly handled.
    <br>
    - For checked exceptions, you either have to put a try/catch block around the code that could potentially throw
    the exception, or add a "throws" clause to the method, to indicate that the method might throw this type of
    exception (which must be handled in the calling class or above). <br>
    - Any exception that derives from <code>Exception</code> is a checked exception, whereas a class that derives
    from
    <code>RuntimeException</code> is un-checked. RuntimeExceptions do not need to be explicitly handled by the
    calling code.
    <br>

    50) Why can't <code>this()</code> and <code>super()</code> be used together in the same constructor? <br>
    - There is a difference between <code>super()</code> and <code>this()</code>. <br>
    <code>super</code>: calls the base class constructor. If no super() is explicitly written,the compiler will add
    one implicitly. <br>
    <code>this</code>: calls current class constructor<br>
    - Both <code>this()</code> and <code>super()</code> are constructor calls. Constructor call must always be the
    first statement. So you either have <code>super()</code> or <code>this()</code> as first statement. <br>
    - In places where you have to use both <code>this()</code> and <code>super()</code>, make sure that last
    constructor to be called is the <code>super()</code> constructor. <a

    58) Difference between Abstract classes and interface in java 8 <br>
    - Java Doc Source <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html">here</a>. <br>
    - An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract - it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
    <br>
    - An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this: <br>
    <code>abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);</code> <br>
    - If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself <i>must</i> be declared abstract. <br>
    - When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the
    subclass must also be declared abstract. <br>
    - Methods in an interface that are not declared as default or static are implicitly abstract, so the abstract modifier is not used with interface methods. (It can be used,
    but it is unnecessary.) <br>
    - You <code>extends</code> a abstract class. You do not <code>implements</code> an abstract class. <br>

    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/62458290/8742428">Read differences here on SO</a>. <br>

    <code>public</code>,
    <code>static</code> and <code>final</code>. Whereas in Abstract classes you can define <code>private</code> variables. <br>

    64) Java: compiled or interpreted? Compiler vs Interpreter? JIT Compiled vs Interpreted? Traditional interpreter vs Traditional Compiler vs JIT Compiler vs AOT Compiler?
    <br>
    - The main thing to keep in mind: JVM has, both, an interpreter as well as a compiler. With JVM, both interpreter
    and compiler (the JVM compiler and not the source-code compiler like javac) produce native code (aka Machine
    language code for the underlying physical CPU like x86)
    from byte code. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40876067/8742428">Source on SO</a>. So when people talk
    about compiling java code, there are two different compilers in picture - one is the <code>javac</code> compiler
    converting the .java files to .class files and then there is the compiler in the JVM itself that is converting
    <i>parts</i> of the bytecode to native instructions that can be run on the CPU/machine code (This is the
    JIT-Compilation that people refer to). <br>

    <li><u>Java: compiled or interpreted</u></li>
    - First of all, <a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3440297/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-compiled-language-or-interpreted-language">there
    is no such thing as a "compiled language" or an "interpreted language"</a>. <br>
    - Generally, both interpreters and compilers first need to parse the source code and turn it into a
    representation, called AST (abstract syntax tree). A compiler then turns the AST into executable code (through
    various transformations), while an interpreter might just directly 'interpret' the AST or sometimes compile and
    execute it (just-in-time compilation).
    The statement that there is nothing like a "compiled language" or an "interpreted language" is correct in that
    this has nothing to do with the language: in theory, you can write an
    interpreter and compiler for any language. Which one to use really depends on the use-case, scenario and
    environment.
    A compiler has the advantage that it only needs to do it's job once, regardless of how often you then execute
    the program. An interpreter needs to parse the source every time (or do some caching), thus you have an overhead
    for each execution which might take way longer than the actual execution time of the final program. On the other
    hand, an interpreter is more flexible (it can take into amount the current environment and thus do optimizations
    a compiler is not allowed to do). But the differences don't stop here, these are just two obvious points. <a

    <li><u>Compiler vs Interpreter</u></li>
    - So we first need to understand what is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter. Check <a
    href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/269878">Source on SO here</a>. <br>
    - To convert source code into machine code, we use either a compiler or an interpreter. Both compilers and
    interpreters are used to convert a program written in a high-level language into machine code understood by
    computers. However, there are differences between how an interpreter and a compiler works. Look at the
    interpreter vs compiler table at
    <a href="https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter">this link</a> and <a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30669166/8742428">this SO answer</a>. <br>
    - On a higher level, the difference really comes down to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/475286/8742428">'prepare
    the code for later execution' (compilation) or 'execute the code right now' (interpretation)</a>. Some
    interpreters (e.g. Unix shells) read the description one small piece at a time and act on each piece as they see
    it; some (e.g. Perl, Python) read the entire description, internally convert it to a simpler form and then act
    on that. Some interpreters (e.g. Java's JVM, or a Pentium 4 chip) only understand a very simple description
    language that is too tedious for humans to work with directly, so humans use compilers to convert their
    high-level descriptions to this language. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/475461/8742428">Compilers never
    do the work. Interpreters always do the work</a>. <br>
    - A compiled language is one where the program, once compiled,
    is expressed in the instructions of the target machine. For example, an addition "+" operation in your source
    code could be translated directly to the "ADD" instruction in machine code.
    An interpreted language is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but
    instead read and executed by some other program (which normally is written in the language of the native
    machine). For example, the same "+" operation would be recognised by the interpreter at <i>run-time</i>, which
    would
    then call its own "add(a,b)" function with the appropriate arguments, which would then <i>execute</i> the
    machine code
    "ADD" instruction. (Note that, in the case of interpreted languages, all of this is happening during run-time.)
    <br>
    - Advantages of compiled languages: <br>
    a) Faster performance by directly using the native code of the target machine. It takes large amount of time to
    analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. <br>
    b) Opportunity to apply quite powerful optimisations during the compile stage <br>
    - Disadvantages of compiled languages: <br>
    a) Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. <br>
    b) It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard.
    <br>
    - Advantages/disadvantages of interpreted languages: <br>
    a) Easier to implement (writing good compilers is very hard!!) <br>
    b) No need to run a compilation stage: can execute code directly "on the fly". It takes less amount of time to
    analyze the source code and <i>start</i> running it, but the overall execution time is slower. <br>
    c) Can be more convenient for dynamic languages <br>
    d) No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient. <br>
    e) Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is
    easy. <br>
    Note that modern techniques such as bytecode compilation add some extra complexity - what happens here is that
    the compiler targets a "virtual machine" which is not the same as the underlying hardware. These virtual machine
    instructions can then be compiled again at a later stage to get native code (e.g. as done by the Java JVM JIT
    compiler). <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3265602/8742428">Source on SO here</a>. <br>
    - You can now see the problem with a purely interpreted language. A traditional compiler is translating all the
    source code to machine code <i>before</i> the execution of the program. Hence at runtime, all the CPU has to do
    is run the machine code instructions (for eg. ADD). On the other hand, for a purely interpreted language, the
    source code needs to
    be translated to the machine code for every instruction - <i>at runtime</i>. If an instruction is present in a
    loop, the interpreter might end up translating the same source code to machine code millions of time. This is a
    huge overhead.

    <br>
    <br>

    <li><u>JIT Compilers</u></li>
    So that brings us to the solution - that is : Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation. <br>
    - Source on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40876067/8742428">SO here</a>. <br>
    - An interpreter pretty much converts each byte-code instruction to corresponding native instruction by looking
    up
    a predefined JVM-instruction to machine instruction mapping (see below pic). Interestingly, a further speedup in
    execution can be achieved, if we take a section of byte-code and convert it into machine code - because
    considering a whole logical section often provides rooms for optimization as opposed to converting
    (interpreting) each line in isolation (to machine instruction). This very act of converting a section of
    byte-code into (presumably optimized) machine instruction is called compiling (in the current context). When the
    compilation is done at run-time, the compiler is called JIT compiler.

         width="35%"
         class="center-block img-fluid"
         alt="Instructions showing conversion of Byte Code to Machine Code">
    Since Java designer went for (hardware & OS) portability, they had chosen interpreter architecture (as opposed
    to c style compiling, assembling, and linking). However, in order to achieve more speed up, a compiler is also
    optionally added to a JVM. Nonetheless, as a program goes on being interpreted (and executed in physical CPU)
    "hotspot"s are detected by JVM and statistics are generated. Consequently, using statistics from interpreter,
    those sections become candidate for compilation (optimized native code). It is in fact done on-the-fly (thus JIT
    compiler) and the compiled machine instructions are used subsequently (rather than being interpreted). In a
    natural way, JVM also caches such compiled pieces of code.

    <li><u>Bringing it all together with a Java JIT Compiler</u></li>

    <br>
    - Java implementations typically use a two-step compilation process. Java source code is compiled down to
    bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use a
    technique called <i>Just-in-Time (JIT)</i> compilation to compile the bytecode to native instructions understood
    by
    hardware CPU on the fly at runtime. Some implementations of JVM may choose to <i>interpret</i> the bytecode
    instead of
    JIT compiling it to machine code, and running it directly. While this is still considered an "interpreter," it's
    quite different from interpreters that read and execute the high level source code (i.e. in this case, Java
    source code is not interpreted directly, the bytecode, output of Java compiler, is). It is technically possible
    to compile Java down to native code ahead-of-time and run the resulting binary. It is also possible to interpret
    the Java code directly. <br>
    - To summarize, depending on the execution environment, bytecode can be: <br>
    a) compiled ahead of time and executed as native code (similar to most C++ compilers) <br>
    b) compiled just-in-time and executed <br>
    c) interpreted <br>
    d) directly executed by a supported processor (bytecode is the native instruction set of some CPUs) <br>

    - Browsers are pretty smart when it comes to caching. It should only ask for it once.
    Additionally when it asks the server for an image, it usually sends with the request for the image, a couple of
    headers that tell the server.. Hey, I want this image, but I got one already that has these attributes that you
    told me about it last time you sent it to me.
    The server can then respond with a <code>200</code> meaning it's different content <code>304</code> meaning the
    one you have is the same, so I won't send it again, use the one you got.

    66.1) Can overridden methods return different types? <br>
    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14694885/8742428">Source on SO</a>. <br>
    - Yes it may differ but there are some limitations. Before Java 5.0, when you override a method, both parameters and return type must match exactly. Java 5.0 it
    introduces a new facility called covariant return type. You can override a method with the same signature but return a subclass of the object returned.
    In other words, a method in a subclass can return an object whose type is a subclass of the type returned by the method with the same signature in the superclass.

    <br>
    - In the below example, you can see that we are trying to override the <i>eat</i> method in the <i>Dog</i> class by passing in a subclass of the <i>Food</i> class,
    <i>Flesh</i>. But the method is NOT overridden. You can test this by adding a <code>@Override</code> annotation on top of the <i>eat()</i> method in the <i>Dog</i> class,
    and the compiler will throw an error saying that "Method does not override method from its superclass". <br>
    - So we set out to <i>override</i> methods, but we ended up <i>overloading</i> methods. <br>

    - Your expectation is wrong. In Java, dynamic method dispatch happens only for the object the method is called on, not for the parameter types of overloaded methods. <br>
    - Citing the Java Language Specification: When a method is invoked (S15.12), the number of actual arguments (and any explicit type arguments) and <i>the compile-time types of
    the arguments</i> are used, at compile time, to determine the signature of the method that will be invoked (S15.12.2). If the method that is to be invoked is an
    instance method, the actual method to be invoked will be determined at run time, using dynamic method lookup (S15.12.4). <br>
    - The last statement is a bit confusing. Can you clarify it further. <br>
    - Sure. The compile time type <i>of the method parameters</i> is used to determine the signature of the method to be called, in this case <i>foo(Object)</i>. At runtime, <i>the
    class of the object the method is called on</i> determines which implementation of that method is called, taking into account that it may be an instance of a subclass of the
    declared type that overrides the method. <br>
    - Rewriting the above code showing this in action:

    - Ability to dispatch a call to a method based on types of arguments is called multiple dispatch. In Java this is done with Visitor pattern. However, since you're dealing with
    Integers and Strings, you cannot easily incorporate this pattern (you just cannot modify these classes). <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1572350/8742428">Source on SO</a>.
    <br>
    - The key to understanding this is that the test for which method or constructor is most specific does not use the actual parameters: the parameters appearing in the
    invocation. They are used only to determine which overloadings are applicable. Once the compiler determines which overloadings are applicable and accessible, it selects the
    most specific overloading, using only the formal parameters: the parameters appearing in the declaration. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1572499/8742428">Source on SO</a>.

    67) Can an <code>abstract</code> class have a constructor? And if yes, what purpose does it satisfy? <br>
    - Yes, when we define a class to be an Abstract Class it cannot be instantiated but that does not mean an
    Abstract class cannot have a constructor. Each abstract class must have a concrete subclass which will implement
    the abstract methods of that abstract class. <br>
    - When we create an object of any subclass all the constructors in the corresponding inheritance tree are
    invoked in the top to bottom approach. The same case applies to abstract classes. Though we cannot create an
    object of an abstract class, when we create an object of a class which is concrete and subclass of the abstract
    class, the constructor of the abstract class is automatically invoked. Hence we can have a constructor in

    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21204334/system-setproperty-and-system-getproperty">Source on

    - <code>System</code> class has a <code>static</code> member variable named <code>props</code> which is of the
    type <code>Properties</code>. <code>Properties</code> extends <code>HashTable</code>. The <code>HashTable</code>
    is defined as <code>Hashtable&lt;Object,Object&gt;</code>. But note that each key and it's corresponding value
    in the property list is a String. So this should answer the first part of your question about <i>where</i> the
    property is saved, like literally. It is stored in a <code>HashTable</code><br>
    - But <i>where</i> is the property stored. You haven't understood how java programs work. When you run a Java
    program, you are actually starting a JVM instance. That instance will have its own System properties. That is
    where you put your property. When you run another program, that will have its own System properties.
    So, you cannot expect a property which you set in one JVM instance to be accessible from another JVM instance!
    <br>
    - When you start a Java process a separate JVM instance is created that runs your process. Also since props is a
    Class variable(not an instance variable) just one copy of it will be present in the corresponding Class instance
    which will be set when that class is loaded. Now this is under the assumption that you do not have any of your
    custom class loaders in which case behavior might be different. But for simplistic scenario you
    System.setProperty() and System.getProperty() will set system properties that you can access via any class
    running as a part of that java process(JVM).

    - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content">Explained on MDN</a>. <br>
    - When you visit a secure web page (that is, using HTTPS), your connection is encrypted with SSL. If the HTTPS page also includes content retrieved through a regular HTTP
    connection, the connection is only partially encrypted. This is called a web page with mixed content. By default, mixed content is blocked in all major browsers. (<a
    href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/bdny">Source</a>) <br>
    - I have not found a way that can display mixed content in browsers. Is it even possible?<br>

    content?</a> <br>
    - Since your application is serving the content over HTTPS, its a must to access other resources also through HTTPS to solve the mixed content issue. The best way to
    approach is to use a proxy. For that you can either setup a proxy manually using EC2 or using a managed service like <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html">AWS CloudFront</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API
    Gateway</a> depending on the nature of the resources you access. If its a REST API use API Gateway and if its more of content (JS, CSS, HTML and other files & etc.) use

    The host, port and scheme (protocol) must be the same in order for the AJAX request to work. You can either make sure that the originating page is on the same host and
    scheme or implement CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) on the target domain to permit this particular request. (But then you are going to run into the mixed content
    problem again). <br>
    - Alternatively to this, you can add this to your header: <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests"&gt;</code>
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/52133425/8742428">Source</a>. <br>
    - Same thing about adding the meta tag explained <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests"> on

    though they have been replaced with secure URLs (those served over HTTPS). This directive is intended for web sites with large numbers of insecure legacy URLs that need to
    be rewritten. <br>

    84) Why would you want to use <code>static</code> variables in a class? <br>
    - Think of <code>static</code> variables as metadata, i.e., data about data. What this means is that if you want to store information about the class itself, in that case
    you would be better off using <code>static</code> variables. <br>
    - Consider the following example: you have a brand of a car, say Ferrari CX. There is a base price associated with the car. This base price is going to be constant across
    all instantiations of the same car. In that case, you would want to declare the base price as a <code>static</code> variable. <br>
    - (<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/General/JavaSyntax/static.html">Source</a>) The general rule is: Avoid static. However: <br>
    a) The main method must be static. When the program first starts, there are no instances (objects) yet to talk to, so you cannot start from an instance method. However, the
    classes themselves have been created, so static methods can be used. <br>
    b) When you want to have a variable that describes something about the class itself, not the individual objects of that class, make it static. <br>
    c) When you want to have a variable that always has the same value for every object of the class, forever and ever, make it static. <br>
    d) If you have a method that does not use any instance variables or instance methods, you should probably make it static. <br>
    - <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-static#3-key-points-to-remember-1">Source</a> Key points to remember when using a <code>static</code> variable: <br>
    - static methods in Java are resolved at compile time. Since method overriding is part of Runtime Polymorphism, so static methods can't be overridden <br>
    - abstract methods can't be static <br>
    - static methods cannot use this or super keywords <br>
    - The following combinations of the instance, class methods and variables are valid: <br>
    a) Instance methods can directly access both instance methods and instance variables <br>
    b) Instance methods can also access static variables and static methods directly <br>
    c) static methods can access all static variables and other static methods <br>
    d) static methods cannot access instance variables and instance methods directly; they need some object reference to do so <br>
    - Question: when you use the <code>new</code> keyword to create an object, that object is created on the heap. Where are <code>static</code> variables stored then? Does it
    matter?

    85) What are <code>native</code> methods in Java? How can I see the implementations of them? <br>
    - The <code>native</code> keyword is applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface). The actual
    implementation doesn't have to use JNI. () Certain JRE methods are handled intrinsically by the JVM. In fact, it's not even mandatory that the implementation is actually
    native code. It’s just <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se11/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6-200-A.1">"implemented in a language other than the Java programming

    88) What are the rules for casting in Java? How does it work? <br>
    - <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-type-casting">Read here on Baeldung</a>. <br>
    - The important thing to understand is that by casting a reference, you are not changing the actual object that the reference was pointing to in any way. <br>
    - You can either <i>Upcast</i> a reference (eg. casting a <code>ArrayList</code> to a <code>List</code>) which will limit the properties and methods that you can access on
    the object. Else, you can <i>Downcast</i> an object, which will increase the properties and methods that you can access on the object. <br>
    - Upcasting in the same inheritance tree is done implicitly (again, think about casting a <code>ArrayList</code> to a <code>List</code>. You never have to mention the cast.
    The compiler automatically does that for you). <br>
    - In upcasting, the following apply: <br>
    a) A reference variable can refer to an object if the object is of the same type as a variable or if it is a subtype. <br>
    b) Upcasting happens implicitly. <br>
    c) All Java objects are polymorphic and can be treated as objects of supertype due to upcasting. <br>

      </div>
    </div>

    - Then you have <i>Downcasting</i>. It's the casting from a superclass to a subclass.<br>
    - In the above example, we used the <i>Animal</i> reference to point to a <i>Cat</i> object. But as we noticed, it is not possible to call the <i>meow()</i> method on the
    <i>Cat</i> object if the reference is of type <i>Animal</i>. Hence, in this case, we need to Downcast the Animal to a Cat.
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

      </div>
    </div>

    - Running into <code>ClassCastException</code>. <br>
    - Why did we have to use the <code>instance of</code> operator to check whether the reference is of type <i>Cat</i> before we called the <i>meow</i> method on it? <br>
    - Let's remove that and see what happens. We get the following error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: class JoshuaBloch.Chapter3.Dog cannot be cast
    to class JoshuaBloch.Chapter3.Cat. <br>
    - Point to note is that the code compiled without any errors. It is only when we ran the program that we found out the issue. So the point is,
    <code>ClassCastException</code> is not going to be warned by the compiler. You as a developer are responsible for making sure that the code will not throw any such
    exception. <br>
    - Understand that the exception is thrown because you initially stored both, a <i>Dog</i> and a <i>Cat</i> object in the List (because you used the <code>new</code>
    operator to do it, even though the reference that you used to access the object was an <i>Animal</i> reference). But like we saw above, casting does not change the object
    in any way. All it does is change the way in which you access the methods and properties on the object. Hence even though the reference assigned to the <i>Dog</i> object is
    <i>Animal</i>, the <i>object</i> intrinsically is still a <i>Dog</i> object. And when you try to cast that <i>Dog</i> object to a <i>Cat</i> object, the JVM is unable to do
    it because you are trying to downcast to a type that does not match the type of the actual object. <br>

    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5289493/8742428">Another explanation on SO</a>. <br>
    - Suppose we want to cast object <i>d</i> to <i>A</i> <code>A a = (C) d;</code> <br>
    - Internally, 3 rules will be checked by the Compiler and the JVM. The compiler is checking the first two rules at compile-time and the JVM is checking the last one at
    runtime. <br>
    a) Rule 1: Type of <i>d</i> and <i>C</i> must have some relation (child to parent or parent to child or same type). If there is no relationship then we will get a compile
    error (inconvertible types). <br>

    89) What are <code>&lt;init&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;clinit&gt;</code>? What are the differences between them? <br>
    - <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-init-clinit-methods">Explained here on Baeldung</a>. To better understand how initialization works in the JVM, it's highly
    recommended to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se14/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.5">read the JVM specification</a>. <br>
    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8517121/java-what-is-the-difference-between-init-and-clinit">Source on SO</a>. <br>
    - <code>&lt;init&gt;</code> is the (or one of the) constructor(s) for the instance, and non-static field initialization. <br>
    - <code>&lt;clinit&gt;</code> are the static initialization blocks for the class, and static field initialization.

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="inline-heading">What commands can I use to see the detail of the <code>&lt;clinit&gt;</code> of some class of Java?</p> <br>
    - The <code>javap</code> commands displays the <code>&lt;init&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;clinit&gt;</code> methods. (<a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54838384/8742428">Source on SO. Good explanation</a>).

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="inline-heading">Who invokes the class initializer method <code>&lt;init&gt;</code> and when?</p> <br>
    - <code>&lt;clinit&gt;</code> is a static method added by javac and called by JVM after class loading. We can see this method in class bytecode with bytecode outline tools.
    Note that <code>&lt;clinit&gt;</code> is added only if a class needs static initialization.

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="inline-heading">How is all of this related to the <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code> that we are seeing?</p><br>
    - Read about the error <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-exceptionininitializererror">here on Baeldung</a>. <br>
    - Note the following points that are present in the page: <br>
    - The <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code> indicates that an unexpected exception has occurred in a static initializer. Basically, when we see this exception, we should
    know that Java failed to evaluate a static initializer block or to instantiate a static variable. In fact, every time any exception happens inside a static initializer,
    Java automatically wraps that exception inside an instance of the <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code> class. This way, it also maintains a reference to the actual
    exception as the root cause. <br>
    - And this is exactly what is happening in our case as well. The <i>BaseComponent</i> class has a <code>static</code> initialization block, and within that block is a
    method that calls another <code>static</code> method on the <i>BaseComponentPropertyAdapter</i> class (<i>getTypeSingleton</i> is the method that is called on the
    <i>BaseComponentPropertyAdapter</i>). And the <i>getTypeSingleton</i> throws a NPE. Hence, since the <i>static </i> initialization block has run into an exception in the
    form of a NPE, we get a <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code>, as has been mentioned in the previous point. <br>
    - Note that the <code>&lt;clinit&gt;</code> method is a <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-init-clinit-methods#clinit">class initialization method</a> in the JVM.

    <p class="inline-heading">How does hot-swapping in the case of servers like Tomcat work</p>? <br>
    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60439461/how-many-times-can-a-clinit-method-execute-in-java">Source on SO</a>. <br>
    - A class static initializer is called each time a class is loaded. <br>
    - A class named <i>com.example.Data</i> loaded by ClassLoader <i>C1</i> and a class named <i>com.example.Data</i> loaded by ClassLoader <i>C2</i> are different
    classes, and trying to cast an instance of one class to the other class will result in a <code>ClassCastException</code>. <br>
    - With multiple classloaders, even though strictly speaking they would be different objects, you can't count on the initialization code being run exactly one time,
    so you at least have to keep that in mind when writing the <code>init</code> code. <br>
    - Instantiating directly with the <code>new</code> operator and again via reflection still uses only one <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html"><code>ClassLoader</code></a>. <br>
    - An application can create new classloaders and load classes with them. ClassA loaded with the new classloader is technically a different class than ClassA loaded
    with the default classloader. Tomcat (and I assume others) uses this technique to re-load a running web application. You can, for example, fix a bug in SomeClass and drop
    the new .class file into the running application without re-deploying the whole application or taking Tomcat down. Tomcat will notice the update and load new instances of
    the classes in the app. This is an example of the hot-fix or the hot-deploy functionality of the servers. This shows that it is possible and there are cases where a
    class may be loaded by more than one classloader and, therefore, the clinit could be called more than once. <br>
    - There is a difference between hot-deploy and hot-swap as mentioned in <a href="http://arhipov.blogspot.com/2016/02/hotswap-vs-hot-deploy_12.html">this blog post</a>.
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35249234/how-hot-deployment-works-internally">This SO answer</a> goes into details about how hot-deploy is done. <br>

    - Arrowheads are of two types: closed arrowhead and open arrowheads. <br>
    - Closed arrowheads are used to represent relations for <code>implements</code> and <code>extends</code>. A dotted line with a closed arrowhead implies <code>implements</code>.
    A solid line with closed arrowhead implies <code>extends</code>. <br>
    - Open arrowheads are used to represent association/dependency relations. A dotted line with an open arrowhead means that there is a relationship of dependency. Dependency can
    exist in multiple cases like one class accepts the dependent class as an args for one of its methods, or returns the other class type from one of its methods. A solid line with
    a open arrowhead means a relationship of association.
    - Composition is usually indicated by line connecting two classes with addition of a solid diamond at end of the class who owns the creational responsibility.

    - Put simply: <code>= my() {};</code> means that there's an anonymous implementation, not simple instantiation of an object, which should have been: <code>= my()</code>. You

    97) You can pass code as data in java using lambda expressions. How do you do this? <br>
    - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1073358/function-pointers-in-java">SO Link</a>. <br>
    - Suppose there is a function that you want to execute as a callback. For eg. when the user clicks on the close button on a popup, and in response you want to call a method
    that will be executed. The straight-forward way of doing this would be to add a close handler to the popup (assume the popup has such a method that allows you to do so), such
    that when you clicked on the close button, the method was called. But for this it is necessary that the function you want to add as a callback is in scope. <br>
    - Consider the following code. In the below example, the <i>onBindingEditorPopupClose</i> is defined in the same class, and hence we can add the method as a callback.
    <div class="code-block">
      <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
        <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e5174b46e538c55a0abd861685bc962a.js"></script>
      </div>
    </div>

    - But now suppose if you wanted to refactor the <i>BindingTextBox</i> class such that the <i>createPopup</i> no longer <i>returned</i> the instance of the popup that it had
    created. In that case you wouldn't have a reference to the popup in the <i>PropertyRow</i> class, hence not allowing you to add the <i>addCloseHandler</i>. You can try to
    add the close handler in the same place where you are instantiating the <i>bindingEditorPopup</i>, but then you would need a reference to the same <i>PropertyRow</i> class
    because that is the class on which the <i>onBindingEditorPopupClose</i> is defined, which in turn means changing the constructor of the <i>BindingEditorPopup</i>, and all the
    other places where the constructor is being used as well. This will in-turn end up changing the dependency graph of the objects are being created as well. Not such a clean way.
    <br>
    - There is an alternate way though. The problem can be solved by passing in the <i>onBindingEditorPopupClose</i> as data. <br>
    <p class="inline-heading">Why does <i>setCloseHandlerCallback</i> use the <code>Runnable</code> interface</p>: The method that we intend to pass in as the callback in this
    case is <i>onBindingEditorPopupClose</i>. <i>onBindingEditorPopupClose</i> does not take in any arguments and returns void. Hence, we need to refer the
    <i>onBindingEditorPopupClose</i> function using an interface that also has the same definition. We could create an interface of ourselves, but java already has such an
    interface in the form of <code>Runnable</code>, and hence that is the interface that we end up using.

      Now long can store 2^63-1 as its largest number = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. But still if you print MICROS_PER_DAY out, you will see that it contains 500654080. This is
      because the entire computation will be done in int arithmetic. Only after the computation completes is the result promoted to a long. By then, it's
      too late. So why is the computation performed in int arithmetic? Because all the factors that are multiplied
      together
      are int values. When you multiply two int values, you get another int value. Java does not have target
      typing,
      a language feature wherein the type of the variable in which a result is to be stored influences the
      type of
      the computation.
      <br>
      It's easy to fix the program by using a long literal in place of an int as the first factor in each
      product.
      This forces all subsequent computations in the expression to be done with long arithmetic.

      When working with large numbers, watch out for overflow - it's a silent killer. Just because a variable
      is
      large enough to hold a result doesn't mean that the computation leading to the result is of the correct
      type.
      <br>
      The rules of promotion in Java are as follows:
      <br>
      Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions. They are as follows: First, all
      byte,
      short, and char values are promoted to int, as just described. Then, if one operand is a long, the whole
      expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float, the entire expression is promoted to float.
      If any of the operands are double, the result is double.

      - Always use a capital el (L) in long literals, never a lowercase el (l). Similarly, avoid using a lone el
      (l) as a variable name. It is difficult to tell by looking at a code snippet whether it prints the list
      l or the number 1.

    tale of 0xcafebabe</a>
    <div>
      The true decimal value of 0xcafebabe is 3,405,691,582 and 0xcafebabea is 54,491,065,322. In binary, they
      can
      be
      represented as follows:
      <br>
      0xcafebabe: 1100 1010 1111 1110 1011 1010 1011 1110 //32bits
      <br>
      0xcafebabea : 1100 1010 1111 1110 1011 1010 1011 1110 1010 //36 bits
      <br>
      But when we try to store it into a long, this happens:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
      This is because 0xcafebabe is stored by default as an int, i.e., 32 bits. Each bit is set separately.
      Representation of 0xcafebabe in 32 bits has its MSB set. Hence JAVA considers it as a negative integer,
      converting it to -889275714.
      <br>
      The same number 0xcafebabe cannot be saved into a long variable if it is converted into its decimal
      representation.

      </div>
      But if instead we do this, then the correct value is stored:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">

        </div>
      </div>
      This is because JAVA saves the number as a 64 bit number. The MSB is not set and hence you can represent
      the true value of the number.
      <br>
      Now what happens if we try to store a 36 bit number - 0xcafebabea? The number clearly cannot fit into an
      int
      and hence we now get a compile error on line 1 (unlike the previous case where 0xcafebabe could fit into
      32
      bits
      and hence we did not get any kind of error). Casting the number into a long is also not going to help
      (as we
      discussed
      in the previous point - already too late by this point) and also seen on line 2. Hence, the correct way
      to
      store the number is to declare it as a
      long as shown in line 3.

      In conclusion:
      To write a negative decimal constant, you use the unary negation operator (-) in combination with a
      decimal
      literal.
      In this way, you can write any int or long value, whether positive or negative, in decimal form, and
      negative decimal constants are clearly identifiable by the presence of a minus sign. Not so for
      hexadecimal
      and octal literals. They can take on both positive and negative values. Hex and octal literals are
      negative
      if their high-order bit is set.
      <br>
      0xcafebabe: 1100 1010 1111 1110 1011 1010 1011 1110 //32bits
      <br>
      So when you do this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="expand-code-snip-btn border border-primary rounded">
          <span class="btn btn-link">Expand Gist <img src="imgs/chevron-expand.svg" alt="Expand Code Snippet"></span>

        </div>
      </div>
      Highest order bit is set. So before storing into the long x variable, as per the 2s complement, the
      complement of the binary number is taken and then 1 is added to that number and then - is appended to it
      giving
      you the final value of -889275714.

      0xcafebabe is stored as an int. As described above,

      <br>
      1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1100 1010 1111 1110 1011 1010 1011 1110 //sign extend because

      <br>
      The problem is caused due to the sign-extension of the int datatype. We declare 0xcafebabe as
      0xcafebabeL
      (line 2)
      and the problem is solved.

      Two's complement representation of -1 is: 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 i.e. all bits are set.
      <br>
      Size of a byte is 8 bits. Casting int into a byte takes the 8 bits starting from the LSB. This will be a
      narrowing operation. byte is a signed datatype. Hence 1111 1111 still represents -1 in byte.
      <br>
      Next step: (char) 1111 1111. Now this is a widening operation to 16 bits. char is an unsigned datatype.
      For
      widening
      operations we have the following rule:
      <br>
      The sign extension behavior when converting from narrower integral types to wider: Sign extension is
      performed
      if the type of the original value is signed; zero extension if it is a char, regardless of the type to
      which it is being converted.
      <br>
      byte is a narrower signed integral type that we are widening by converting to char. So sign extension
      will
      be performed.
      <br>
      (char) (byte) -1 // 1111 1111 1111 1111 = 2^16 - 1 = 65535 (because char is unsigned)
      <br>
      Next step: (int) 1111 1111 1111 1111. Now this is a widening operation. The rule we stated above tells
      us
      that
      since we are widening from a char, we will zero extend the number. Hence the final value becomes:
      <br>
      0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1111 1111 1111 //= 65535
      <br>
      What should you do in case you are widening from a char to an int and you want the sign extension to be
      performed?
      <br>
      Cast the char to a short, which is the same width as a char but signed.
      <br>
      What should you do in case you are widening from a byte value b to a char but do not want the sign
      extension
      to
      be performed?
      <br>
      Use a bit mask to suppress the sign extension.

      b will be promoted to an int (32 bits) for the & operation. In accordance with the widening rule stated
      above
      sign extension will be performed on the byte b. The & operation with 0xff will keep only the right most
      8
      bits,
      changing all the other 24 bits to 0. Now when this is cast into a char it will be a narrowing operation
      that keeps only the rightmost 16 bits and thus we have a way to convert a narrower integral signed type
      to a wider type without sign extension.

      x += i is not a shorthand for x = x + i. The Java language specification says that the compound
      assignment
      E1 op= E2 is equivalent to the simple assignment E1 = (T) ((E1) op (E2)), where T is the type of E1,
      except that E1 is evaluated only once. In the above code, this would mean that x += i would evaluate to:
      x = (char) (x + i)
      <br>
      x is of type short but i of type int. Hence x will be extended to 32 bits. The two numbers will be added
      to give the result 123456, whose binary representation is:
      <br>
      0001 1110 0010 0100 0000.
      The cast into short will lob off everything except the rightmost 16 bits. Hence x = 1110 0010 0100 0000
      which in 2's complement becomes -7616.
      <br>
      In other words, compound assignment expressions automatically cast the result of the computation they
      perform to the type of the variable on their left-hand side. If the type of the result is identical to
      the type of the variable, the cast has no effect. If, however, the type of the result computed after
      performing the operations on the right hand side is wider than
      that of the variable, the compound assignment operator performs a silent narrowing primitive conversion
      [JLS 5.1.3]. Attempting to perform the equivalent simple assignment would generate a compilation error,
      with good reason.
      <br>
      The corresponding simple assignment on line 3 does not work because you are trying to assign an int
      value
      into a short variable which is not possible without using an explicit cast.

      a char to an int zero extends the 16-bit char value to fill the 32-bit int. In the case of 'H', the char
      value is 72 and in the case of 'a', it is 97, so the expression 'H' + 'a' is equivalent to the int
      constant
      72 + 97, or 169.
      <br>
      The + operator performs string concatenation if and only if at least one of its operands is of type
      String;
      otherwise, it performs addition. If none of the values to be concatenated are strings, you have
      several choices: prepend the empty string; convert the first value to a string explicitly, using
      String.valueOf;
      use a string buffer; or if you are using release 5.0, use the printf facility.

      First, understand that although char are represented as integers, many libraries treat it differently.
      For example, when you print a char it is printed as the Unicode character and not the integer.
      <br>
      String conversion for object references, which include arrays, is defined as follows: If the reference
      is
      null,
      it is converted to the string "null". Otherwise, the conversion is performed as if by an invocation of
      the toString method of the referenced object with no arguments; but if the result of invoking the
      toString
      method is null, then the string "null" is used instead. (??)
      Arrays inherit the toString method from Object, whose specification says, "Returns a string consisting
      of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character '@', and the
      unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object"

      You should by this point probably know that pig == dog will return false. The == operator, does not test
      whether two objects are equal; it tests whether two object references are identical. Which in this case,
      they are not.
      But the output in this case is: false. Yes. Not "Animals are equal: false". But just "false". Why
      though?
      <br>
      The + operator, whether used for addition or string concatenation, binds more tightly than the ==
      operator.
      Therefore, the parameter of the println method is evaluated like this:
      <br>
      System.out.println(("Animals are equal: " + pig) == dog);
      <br>
      The value of the boolean expression is, of course, false, and that is exactly what the program prints.
      There is one surefire way to avoid this sort of difficulty: When using the string concatenation
      operator,
      always parenthesize nontrivial operands.

      The backslash is used as a marker character to tell the compiler/interpreter that the next character has
      some
      special meaning. What that next character means is up to the implementation. For example C-style
      languages
      use \n to mean newline and \t to mean tab. The use of the word "escape" really means to temporarily
      escape
      out of parsing the text and into a another mode where the subsequent character is treated differently.
      Any quote (") that is preceded by a slash (\") is escaped, and understood to be part of the value of the
      string.
    </div>

  <div class="one-point">
    13) So what does it mean to escape in regex?
    <div>
      Many characters in regular expressions have special meanings. For instance, the dot character '.' means
      "any one character". There are a great deal of these specially-defined characters, and sometimes, you
      want
      to search for one, not use it's special meaning. (<a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37064290/what-does-escape-a-string-mean-in-regex-javascript">Source</a>)
      <br>
      From MSDN:
      <br>
      The character that follows it is a special character, as shown in the table in the following section.
      For example, \b is an anchor that indicates that a regular expression match should begin on a word
      boundary,
      \t represents a tab, and \x020 represents a space.
      A character that otherwise would be interpreted as an unescaped language construct should be interpreted
      literally.
      For example, a brace ({) begins the definition of a quantifier, but a backslash followed by a brace (\{)
      indicates that the regular expression engine should match the brace. Similarly, a single backslash marks
      the beginning of an escaped language construct, but two backslashes (\\) indicate that the regular
      expression
      engine should match the backslash.

      The key to understanding this puzzle is that Java provides no special treatment for Unicode escapes
      within string literals. The compiler translates Unicode escapes into the characters they represent before it parses the program into tokens, such as strings literals
      [JLS 3.2]. Therefore, the first Unicode escape in the program
      closes a one-character string literal ("a"), and the second one opens a one-character string literal
      ("b").
      The program prints the value of the expression: "a".length() + "b".length(), or 2.
      The third example prints 16 because you are escaping the quotation with a backslash.
      <br>
      Unicode escapes are designed for use when a programmer needs to insert a character that can't be
      represented
      in the source file's character set. They are used primarily to put non-ASCII characters into
      identifiers,
      string literals, character literals, and comments. Occasionally, a Unicode escape adds to the clarity of
      a program by positively identifying one of several similar-looking characters.

        This program isn't even guaranteed to terminate normally, much less to print any particular
        sequence.
        Its behavior is completely unspecified. The culprit here is the String(byte[]) constructor. Its
        specification says:
        "Constructs a new String by decoding the specified byte array using the platform's default charset.
        The length of the new String is a function of the charset, and hence may not be equal to the length
        of the byte array. The behavior of this constructor when the given bytes are not valid in the
        default
        charset is unspecified"
        <br>
        What exactly is a charset? Technically, it is "the combination of a coded character set and a
        character-encoding scheme" [Java-API]. In other words, a charset is a bunch of characters, the
        numerical codes that represent them, and a way to translate back and forth between a sequence of
        character codes and a sequence of bytes. The translation scheme differs greatly among charsets. Some
        have a one-to-one mapping between characters and bytes; most do not.
        <br>
        If you want to know your JRE's default charset and you are using release 5.0 or a later release, you
        can find out by invoking:
        <br>
        System.out.println(java.nio.charset.Charset.defaultCharset()); // Prints UTF-8
        <br>
        When translating between char sequences and byte sequences, you can and usually should specify a
        charset
        explicitly.
        The lesson of this puzzle is that every time you translate a byte sequence to a String, you are
        using
        a charset, whether you specify it explicitly or not. If you want your program to behave predictably,
        specify a charset each time you use one.

      There are 3 bugs in this code:
      <br>
      a) rnd.nextInt(2) generates numbers exclusive of 2. So the numbers generated are: {0,1}. Hence case2 is
      never triggered.
      The specification for Random.nextInt(int) says: "Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value
      between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive). Whenever you are working with lengths,
      ranges,
      or moduli, be careful to determine which endpoints should be included, and make sure that your code
      behaves accordingly.
      <br>
      b) There is no break after the case. So if case 1 is triggered, so will case2 and 3.
      <br>
      c) StringBuffer(int capacity); takes as an argument an integer that specifies the capacity of the
      buffer.
      By using a character, you are implicitly converting it into an int by widening. Which as you might have

      The problem is that String.replaceAll takes a regular expression as its first parameter, not a literal
      sequence of characters.
      (Regular expressions were added to the Java platform in release 1.4.) The regular expression "." matches
      any
      single character, and so every character of the class name is replaced by a slash, producing the output
      we
      saw.
      To match only the period character, the period in the regular expression must be escaped by preceding it
      with a backslash (\). Because the backslash character has special meaning in a string literal-it begins
      an escape sequence - the backslash itself must be escaped with a second backslash. This produces an
      escape
      sequence that generates a backslash in the string literal.
      <br>
      System.out.println(Me.class.getName().replaceAll("\\.", "/") + ".class");
      <br>
      This prints: com/company/Chapter3/com/javapuzzlers/Me.class
      <br>
      Which is what we wanted.
      <br>
      Another problem with this program is that the correct behavior is platform dependent. Not all file
      systems use the slash character to separate hierarchical filename components. To get a valid filename
      for the platform on which you are running, you should use the correct platform-dependent separator
      character in place of the slash.

      We already looked at what goes wrong in this case. 0x90 is, by default, stored as an integer. Not as a

      <br>
      0x90 is: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001 0000 which is equal to +144
      <br>
      Byte.MIN_VALUE = -128
      <br>
      Byte.MAX_VALUE = 127
      <br>
      So the if condition will never be triggered. In order for the if condition to be triggered, we need to

      When placed after a variable, the ++ operator functions as the postfix increment operator [JLS 15.14.2]:
      The value of the expression j++ is the original value of j before it was incremented. Therefore, the
      preceding assignment first saves the value of j, then sets j to its value plus 1, and, finally, resets j
      back to its original value. In other words, the assignment is equivalent to this sequence of statements:

      This program will never terminate. The for loop condition uses the statement i <= END. When i = END, the
      value of i
      will overflow to a negative value and i will still be lesser than END. Hence the condition will always
      be
      satisfied.
      If you need a loop that iterates near the boundaries of the int values, you are better off using a long

      The constant -1 is the int value with all 32 bits set (0xffffffff). The left-shift operator shifts
      zeroes
      in from the right to fill the low-order bits vacated by the shift, so the expression (-1 << i) has its
      rightmost i bits set to 0 and the remaining 32 - i bits set to 1. The problem is that (-1 << 32) is
      equal
      to -1 rather than 0, because shift operators use only the five low-order bits of their right operand as
      the shift distance, or six bits if the left operand is a long [JLS 15.19].
      <br>
      This applies to all three shift operators: <<, >>, and >>>. The shift distance is always between 0 and
      31,
      or 0 and 63 if the left operand is a long. (This means that whatever shift count you pass, it will be
      interpreted modulo 32. Attempting to shift by 32 on such platform will actually shift by 0, i.e.
      not shift at all.) It is calculated mod 32, or mod 64 if the left operand is a long. Attempting to shift
      an int value 32 bits or a long value 64 bits just returns the value itself. There is no shift distance
      that discards all 32 bits of an int value or all 64 bits of a long value.
      <br>
      Another important point is that the left-shift operator with a -ve shift does not act as a right shift
      operator.
      A right shift always functions as a right shift, and a left shift always functions as a left shift.
      Negative shift distances are made positive by lopping off all but the five low order bits-six bits if
      the left operand is a long. (<a

      Java mandates the use of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic [IEEE-754], which lets you represent
      infinity
      as a double or float. As we learned in school, infinity plus 1 is still infinity. If i is initialized to
      infinity before the loop starts, the termination test (i == i + 1) evaluates to true, and the loop never
      terminates.
      <br>
      So, the next question is, how do you initialize something to infinity?
      <br>
      There are few ways:

      The distance between adjacent floating-point values is called an ulp, which is an acronym for unit in
      the
      last place.
      In release 5.0, the Math.ulp method was introduced to calculate the ulp of a float or double value.
      Floating-point operations return the floating-point value that is closest to their exact mathematical
      result.
      Once the distance between adjacent floating-point values is greater than 2, adding 1 to a floating-point
      value will have no effect, because the half-way point between values won't be reached. For the float
      type,
      the least magnitude beyond which adding 1 will have no effect is 2^25, or 33,554,432; for the double
      type,
      it is 2^54, or approximately 1.8 × 10^16.

        IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic reserves a special value to represent a quantity that is not a
        number
        [IEEE-754].
        This value, known as NaN (short for "Not a Number"), is the value of all floating-point computations
        that do
        not have well-defined numeric values, such as 0.0 / 0.0. The specification says that NaN is not
        equal to
        any floating-point value, including itself. Therefore, if i is initialized to NaN before the loop
        starts,
        the termination test (i != i) evaluates to true, and the loop never terminates. Strange but true.

        The thing to remember over here is that + is an overloaded operator. When the arguments to + are

        the + operator ends up concatenating the strings. If one operand in the concatenation is of some

        The key to solving this puzzle is that >>>= is a compound assignment operator. Suppose that you
        precede
        the loop with the following
        declaration:
        <br>
        short i = -1;
        <br>
        Because the initial value of i ((short)0xffff) is nonzero, the body of the
        loop is executed. The first step in the execution of the shift operation is that the
        value of i is promoted to an int. All arithmetic operations do this to operands of
        type short, byte, or char. This promotion is a widening primitive conversion, so
        no information is lost. This promotion performs sign extension, so the resulting
        int value is 0xffffffff. This value is then shifted to the right by one bit without
        sign extension to yield the int value 0x7fffffff. Finally, this value is stored
        back into i. In order to store the int value into the short variable, Java performs
        the dreaded narrowing primitive conversion, which simply lops off the high-order
        16 bits of the value. This leaves (short)0xffff, and we are back where we
        started. The second and successive iterations of the loop behave identically, so the
        loop never terminates.
        <br>
        Similar behavior occurs if you declare i to be a short or byte variable initialized to any negative
        value.
        You will not get an infinite loop if you declare i to be a
        char, as char values are unsigned, so the widening primitive conversion that
        occurs prior to the shift doesn't perform sign extension.
        <br>
        <em>In summary, do not use compound assignment operators on short, byte, or char variables. </em>
        <br>
        Such expressions perform mixed-type arithmetic, which can be confusing in and of itself. Far worse,
        they
        perform an implicit narrowing cast, which can discard information.

        Until release 5.0, Java's numerical comparison operators (<, <=, >, and >=) required both of their
        operands to be of a primitive numeric type (byte, char, short, int, long, float, or double) [JLS2
        15.20.1].
        In release 5.0, the specification was changed to say that the type of each operand must be
        convertible
        to a primitive numeric type [JLS 15.20.1, 5.1.8].
        <br>
        Check <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18804599/why-does-i-j-j-i-i-j-evaluate-to-true/18804642">this
        link</a> for details.
        <br>
        The first two subexpressions (i <= j and j <= i) perform unboxing conversions [JLS 5.1.8] on i and j
        and compare the resulting int values numerically. Both i and j represent 0, so both of these
        subexpressions
        evaluate to true. The third subexpression (i != j) performs an identity comparison on the object
        references
        i and j. The two variables refer to distinct objects, as each was initialized to a new Integer
        instance.
        Therefore, the third subexpression also evaluates to true, and the loop spins forever.
        The equality operators do perform numerical comparison when only one of their two operands is of a
        boxed numeric type and the other is of a primitive type.
        <br>
        The <= operator is still antisymmetric on the set of primitive numeric values, but now it applies to
        operands of boxed numeric types as well. (The boxed numeric types are Byte, Character, Short,
        Integer,
        Long, Float, and Double). The <= operator is not antisymmetric on operands of these types, because
        Java's
        equality operators (== and !=) perform reference identity comparison rather than value comparison
        when
        applied to object references.

        In the boolean expression (i == -i && i != 0), the unary minus operator is applied to i, which
        implies
        that its type must be numeric: It is illegal to apply the unary minus operator to a non-numeric
        operand.
        Therefore, we are looking for a nonzero numeric value that is equal to its own negation.
        NaN does not satisfy this property, as it is not equal to any value, so i must represent an actual
        number.
        No floating-point value other than 0 is equal to itself with the sign bit flipped, so the type of i
        must
        be integral.
        <br>
        There is, however, a corresponding disadvantage. There exist an even number of int values-2^32 to be
        precise-and one of these values is used to represent 0. That leaves an odd number of int values to
        represent positive and negative integers, which means that there must be a different number of
        positive
        and negative int values. This in turn implies that there is at least one int value whose negation
        cannot be correctly represented as an int value.
        <br>
        In fact, there is exactly one such int value, and it is Integer.MIN_VALUE, or -2^31 =
        -2,147,483,648.
        <br>
        -2,147,483,648 = 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
        <br>
        Negating this means inverting all of the bits and adding 1 to the value. Which would give the same
        bit
        sequence as the answer.
        <br>
        In other words, Integer.MIN_VALUE is its own negation, as is Long.MIN_VALUE.
        <br>
        Therefore, the declaration of i as:
        <br>
        int i = Integer.MIN_VALUE; //or
        <br>
        long i = Long.MIN_VALUE;

        will cause the above code to loop indefinitely.

      The initial value of f is close to Integer.MAX_VALUE, so it requires 31 bits to express precisely, and
      the float type provides only 24 bits of precision. Incrementing such a large float value will not change
      it.
      The problem is that the termination test fails in much the same way that the increment does. The loop
      runs
      only so long as the loop index f is less than (float)(START + 50). The promotion from int to float is
      performed automatically when comparing an int to a float. Unfortunately, this promotion is one of the
      three widening primitive conversions that can result in loss of precision [JLS 5.1.2].
      (The others are long to float and long to double.)
      <br>
      The initial value of f is so large that adding 50 to it and converting the result to a float produces
      the same value as simply converting f to a float. In other words, (float)2000000000 == 2000000050,
      so the expression f < START + 50 is false before the loop body has executed even once, and the loop body
      never gets a chance to run.

      Fixing this program is as simple as changing the type of the loop variable from a float to an int.
      <br>
      The moral of this puzzle is simple: Do not use floating-point loop indices, because it can lead to
      unpredictable behavior.
      If you need a floating-point value in the body of a loop, take the int or long loop index and convert it
      to a float or double. You may lose precision when converting an int or long to a float or a long to a
      double,
      but at least it will not affect the loop itself. When you use floating-point, use double rather than
      float
      unless you are certain that float provides enough precision and you have a compelling performance need
      to
      use float.
      <br>
      For a variation on the above, note that although g == (g + 50), g != (g + 100). So if we changed our
      above
      program
      to have the loop check changed to: f < START + 100, the program turns into an infinite loop. This is
      because
      now f++ (increment of f by 1) leads to the same value as f.

      The problem lies in the boolean expression (ms % 60*1000 == 0). You might think that this expression is
      equivalent to (ms % 60000 == 0), but it isn't. The remainder and multiplication operators have the same
      precedence [JLS 15.17], so the expression ms % 60*1000 is equivalent to (ms % 60) * 1000.
      This expression is equal to 0 if (ms % 60) is 0, so the loop increments minutes every 60 iterations.
      This accounts for the final result being off by a factor of a thousand.
      <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11precedence/">This link </a>talks more about operator
      precedence.
      Precedence order. When two operators share an operand the operator with the higher precedence goes
      first.
      For example, 1 + 2 * 3 is treated as 1 + (2 * 3), whereas 1 * 2 + 3 is treated as (1 * 2) + 3 since
      multiplication
      has a higher precedence than addition.
      Associativity: When an expression has two operators with the same precedence, the expression is
      evaluated
      according to its associativity.
      <br>
      For example x = y = z = 17 is treated as x = (y = (z = 17)), leaving all three variables with the value
      17,
      since the = operator has right-to-left associativity (and an assignment statement evaluates to the value
      on
      the right hand side).
      On the other hand, 72 / 2 / 3 is treated as (72 / 2) / 3 since the / operator has left-to-right
      associativity.
      Some operators are not associative: for example, the expressions (x <= y <= z) and x++-- are invalid.
