                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/968356973962cf08e0f2f2c18362d15e.js"></script>
            </div>

            - A HTML page contains text and <i>tags</i>. Tags give structure to the text, describing things such as
            links,
            paragraphs, and headings. <br>
            - The <i>tags</i> are wrapped in <code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code>. <br>
            - The document starts with <code>&lt;!doctype html &gt;</code> , which tells the browser to interpret the
            page
            as modern HTML, as opposed to various dialects that were in use in the past. <br>
            - An <i>HTML Element</i> is started by an opening tag like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and ended by a closing tag
            like
            <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. <br>
            - Some opening tags, such as the one for the link (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>), contain extra information in the
            form of
            name="value" pairs. These are called <i>attributes</i>. <br>
            - Some kinds of tags do not enclose anything and thus do not need to be closed. The metadata tag
            <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> is an example of this. <br>
            - <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8937384/what-is-the-difference-between-html-tags-and-elements">This
            SO Link</a> goes into the differences between tags, elements, and attributes. <br>
        </div>

        <br>

        <li><b>HTML and JavaScript</b></li>
        <div>
            - The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag allows us to include a piece of JavaScript in the document.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/0e789c4fbf549605dfbc222ab3a0b761.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Such a script will run as soon as its <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is encountered while the browser
            reads the HTML. <br>
            - The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag can be given an <code>src</code> attribute to fetch a script file (a
            text file containing a JavaScript program) from a URL.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7f2b8663a4ec0d140287489d7903f0f2.js"></script>
            </div>

            - A script tag must always be closed with <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, even if it refers to a script file
            and doesn't contain any code. If you forget this, the rest of the page will be interpreted as part of the
            script. <br>
            - Some attributes can also contain a JavaScript program. The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag (which shows up
            as a button) has an <code>onclick</code> attribute. The attribute's value will be run whenever the button is
            clicked.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/573a1e434a90b447af846adff9625568.js"></script>

            - The data structure the browser uses to represent the document follows the above shape. For each box, there
            is
            an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which boxes
            and
            text it contains. This representation is called the Document Object Model. <br>
            - The global binding (other name for <i>variable</i>) <code>document</code> gives us access to these
            objects. Its <code>documentElement</code> property refers to the object representing the
            <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag.<br>
            - You can think of the DOM as a tree datastructure with the <code>document.documentElement</code> serving as
            the root of the tree. Just like a normal tree, the root is a node. A node can have children nodes
            or can have leaves. <br>
            - Each DOM node object has a <code>nodeType</code> property, which contains a code (number) that identifies
            the type of node. Elements have code 1, which is also defined as the constant property
            <code>Node.ELEMENT_NODE</code>. Text nodes, representing a section of text in the document, get code 3
            (<code>Node.TEXT_NODE</code>). Comments have code 8 (<code>Node.COMMENT_NODE</code>). <br>
            - What is the difference between Node object and Element object?
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9979172/difference-between-node-object-and-element-object">This
                SO Link explains</a>. <code>Element</code> inherits from <code>Node</code>, in the same way that Dog
            inherits from Animal.
            An <code>Element</code> object "is-a" <code>Node</code> object, in the same way that a Dog object "is-a"
            Animal object.<br>
            - Every node has a <code>parentNode</code> property that points to the node it is part of, if any. Likewise,
            every element node (node type 1) has a <code>childNodes</code> property that points to an array-like object
            holding its children. <br>
            - The <code>firstChild</code> and <code>lastChild</code> properties point to the first and last child
            elements or have the value <code>null</code> for nodes without children. <br>
            - Similarly, <code>previousSibling</code> and <code>nextSibling</code> point to adjacent nodes, which are
            nodes with the same parent that appear immediately before or after the node itself. For a first child,
            <code>previousSibling</code> will be null, and for a last child, <code>nextSibling</code> will be null. <br>
            - There's also the <code>children</code> property, which is like <code>childNodes</code> but contains
            only element (type 1) children, not other types of child nodes. This can be useful when you aren't
            interested in text nodes. <br>
            - The <code>nodeValue</code> property of a text node holds the string of text that it represents. <br>
        </div>

        <br>
        <li><b>Finding Elements in the DOM</b></li>
        <div>
            - If we want the <code>href</code> attribute of the link in that document, we can say:

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/f490eb65be0a2eaf4ebd0e89079cd237.js"></script>
            </div>

            - All element nodes have a <code>getElementsByTagName</code> method, which collects all elements with the
            given tag name that are descendants (direct or indirect children) of that node and returns them as an
            array-like object. <br>
            - To find a specific single node, you can give it an <code>id</code> attribute and use
            <code>document.getElementById</code> instead. <br>
            - A third, similar method is <code>getElementsByClassName</code>, which, like
            <code>getElementsByTagName</code>, searches through the contents of an element node and retrieves all
            elements that have the given string in their class attribute. <br>
        </div>

        <br>
        <li><b>Changing the Document</b></li>
        <div>
            - Almost everything about the DOM data structure can be changed. The shape of the document tree can be
            modified by changing parent-child relationships. Nodes have a <code>remove</code> method to remove them from
            their current parent node. To add a child node to an element node, we can use <code>appendChild</code>,
            which puts it at the end of the list of children, or <code>insertBefore</code>, which inserts the node
            given as the first argument before the node given as the second argument. <br>
            - Consider the following:

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/9fcb46cdd39aca71e26586fae4f603f1.js"></script>
            </div>

            - A node can exist in the document in only one place. Thus, inserting paragraph Three in front of paragraph
            One will first remove it from the end of the document and then insert it at the front, resulting in
            Three/One/Two. All operations that insert a node somewhere will, as a side effect, cause it to be removed
            from its current position (if it has one). <br>
            - The <code>replaceChild</code> method is used to replace a child node with another one. It takes as
            arguments two nodes: a new node and the node to be replaced. The replaced node must be a child of the
            element the method is called on. Note that both <code>replaceChild</code> and <code>insertBefore</code>
            expect the new node as their first argument.

        <div>
            - JS can be included in your HTML code in 2 ways - either inline or by pointing to an external js file. <br>
            - Inline js is when it is included in the .html page itself within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags like:
            <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("Hello World")&lt;/script&gt;</code> tags. Pointing to an external js is done as
            follows:
            <code>&lt;script src = "script.js"&gt;&lt;script&gt;</code> i.e. specify the location of the js file. Here
            it means that the script.js file is in the same folder as the html file. <br>
            - In the below image we have moved the js to an external file. Now when we load the index.html page, the
            values from the js file are logged into the console. The console also shows the corresponding file and line
            number that corresponds to the line that is logging the values. The variables that are present in the js
            file, are also in-scope in the console window in the browser. So you can access variables such as <i>js</i>
            and <i>firstName</i> in the console and change their values as required.

            <div class="row">
                <img src="imgs/UdemyCourse/Module2/Image1.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="Example1">
            </div>

            <br>
            - Errors that are present in your js file will appear on the console as follows:

            <div class="row">
                <img src="imgs/UdemyCourse/Module2/Image2.PNG" class="center-block img-fluid" alt="Example1">
            </div>

            - Javascript has dynamic typing. Hence we do not have to manually define the datatype of the value stored in
            the variable. The data types are determined automatically by javascript. This distinction is important - a
            <i>variable</i> simply holds a <i>value</i> and it is the <i>value</i> that determines the <i>type</i>. This
            also means that you can assign a different data type to the same variable in your code. <br>
            - The <code>typeof</code> operator is used to find out the type of the variable. <br>
            - You can check the operator precedence on MDN website <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#Table">here</a>.
            21 is the highest value of precedence. <br>
            - In JS, we have <i>Type Conversion</i> and <i>Type Coercion</i>. Type <i>conversion</i> is when we manually
            convert variables from one type to another. Type <i>coercion</i> is when JS automatically converts the types
            for us, ie. it is an <i>implicit</i> conversion that is hidden from us. <br>
            - In 2009, ES5 (ECMA Script 5) was released. In 2015, ES6/ES2015 (ECMAScript 2015) was released. In 2015,
            the release cycle changed to an annual release cycle. So a anew version of JS is released every year. <br>
            - You can check the entire compatibility of various JS versions <a
                href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">here in this table</a>. <br>
            - ES5 is full supported in all browsers, right down to IE9 from 2011. ES6+ is supported in all modern
            browsers. ES6+ includes all JS version from 2015-2020. Future releases of JS are known as ESNext. These are
            from 2021 onwards.

        <div>
            - Elements, Tags, Attributes, Classes, IDs <br>
            - In HTML, some <i>Element</i>s can have <i>attribute</i>s. These <i>attribute</i>s describe <i>element</i>s.
            <br>
            - For example, consider the following anchor element.
            <code>&lt;a href="https://github.com/rgbk21"&gt;My Github&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Here <code>href</code> is an
            <i>attribute</i> of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> <i>tag</i> because it defines the link to which the anchor
            element should point to. <br>
            - An <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is also known as an <i>inline element</i> because the text contained within the
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags are displayed in-line. Contrast this with something like the &lt;p&gt; tag where
            the text is displayed on a different line. Such an element is known as a <i>Block Element</i>. <br>
            - Similarly you have the <code>&lt;img src="https://github.com/rgbk21"&lt;/&gt;</code> element. An
            <i>img</i> element does not have a closing <i>tag</i>. <br>
            - There are two <i>attribute</i>s that we can use on ALL <i>element</i>s. These are <i>class</i> and
            <i>id</i>. These attributes are used to name the HTML <i>element</i>s so that we can style them using CSS.
            We also use them to select <i>elements</i> from JS when we are doing DOM Manipulation. <br>
            - The difference between <i>class</i>es and <i>id</i>s is that <i>id</i>s are supposed to be unique. That
            is, you can only use an <i>id</i> ONCE, on a page. <br>
            - A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is used to draw a box on the HTML page. <br>
            - A <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element is used to accept input from the user. <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> is
            just a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that has been given some semantic meaning to explain to HTML that we intend
            to take an input from the user. <br>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 66: Basic Styling with CSS</div>
        <div>
            - We use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to link an HTML file to a CSS file. This line is supposed to go
            in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the HTML page. <br>
            - <code>&lt;link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>. This code assumes that the CSS file is in
            the
            same folder as the HTML file. <br>
            - Consider the following HTML File and the CSS associated with it:
            <div class="code-snippet">

            Instead, they are a part of the Web APIs. The Web APIs are libraries that the browser implements - and we
            can access these libraries through our JS code. These web APIs are also written in JS. There is a separate
            DOM specification that each browser implements. Just like DOM, there are other Web APIs as well, like -
            Timers, Fetch, etc. <br>

        <div>
            - JS is: <br>
            - High Level Language: In languages like C, you have to manage the memory yourself. High-level languages
            abstract away the memory management (apart from doing other things). <br>
            - Garbage Collected: One of the tools that takes memory management away from developers is automatic garbage
            collection. <br>
            - Interpreted or Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiled: <br>
            - Multi Paradigm: Paradigm refers to a style of writing code. This can be imperative or declarative. JS can
            support multiple styles of writing code, such as, Procedural (organizing code in a
            very linear way so that the code runs top-to-bottom with functions in between), Object-Oriented,
            Functional <br>
            - Prototype-based Object-Oriented: <br>
            - First-Class functions: functions are treated as regular variables, i.e., we can pass them into other
            functions, and return them from functions. This is what enables functional programming in JS.

            - Dynamically typed: In JS we do not assign datatypes to variables. The dataytpes are known only once JS
            engine executes our code. Also the type of variables can easily be changed by reassigning variables. <br>
            - Single-Threaded: JS runs in one single thread. <br>
            - Non-Blocking Event-Loop: Long running tasks are executed by the event loop in the "background" and then
            put back in the main thread once their execution is complete.

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 90: JS Engine and RunTime</div>
        <div>
            - JS Engine is, simply put, the code that executes the JS code. Every browser has it's own JS engine. The
            most well-known JS engine is Google's V8. The V8 engine powers Google Chrome, but also nodeJS. Other
            browsers have their own JS engines. <br>
            - A JS engine contains a call stack and a heap. The Call Stack is where our JS code is executed using
            something known as the Execution Context. The heap is an unstructured memory pool that stores all the
            objects that our application needs. <br>

            difference between Compiled language vs an Interpreted Language</a> on SO. <br>
            - Before the code can be run by the target system (think your laptop CPU), it needs to be converted to
            machine code (sequence of 0s and 1s). So your JS code has to be converted to machine code. Now how is this
            going to happen? Compilation is the process by which the entire source code (your code) is converted into
            machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed on any computer. Any application
            that you run your machine has been already previously compiled into a binary executable.

            An interpreted language, on the other hand, consists of an interpreter that runs through the source code and
            executes it line-by-line. So, basically, the code is read and executed at the same time. JS used to be an
            interpreted language, but modern JS isn't. This is primarily because interpreted languages are slow, and JS
            couldn't keep up with the development of the browser.

            - TODO: I still don't understand what is actually happening with the JIT Compilation. <br>
            - The first step is parsing the code that reads the JS code and converts it into a datastructure known as
            the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The compilation process takes the generated AST and converts it into machine
            code. This machine code is executed right away because of the JIT compilation of JS. The machine code that
            is generated initially is a very un-optimised version of the code just so that the execution can begin as
            soon as possible. In the background, the machine code is taken and recompiled while the program is already
            executing. During each iteration of the optimisation, the unoptimised code is swapped for the optimised code
            - all while the program is already executing!!

            - A JS Runtime is something that is required to run JS in the browser. It is a combination of JS Engine
            (discussed above), the Web APIs, and the Callback Queue. The Callback Queue is a datastructure that contains
            all the callback functions that are ready to be executed. What are callback functions? The functions that
            you attached to the event listeners are known as callback functions. So when an event happens - like a click
            - the corresponding callback function will be called.
            <div class="row">

            </div>
            - This is how it happens - when a user clicks on a
            button, the callback function is added to the callback queue. Then, once the call stack is <i>empty</i>, the
            callback function is passed to the call stack so that it can be executed. This happens by something known as
            the Event Loop. The event loop picks up functions from the callback queue and places them in the call stack
            so that they can be executed. The event loop is basically how javascript's non-blocking concurrency model is
            implemented.

            - Remember that JS can also exist outside of browsers (nodeJS). In that case, the JS runtime will not
            contain the Web APIs, because the Web APIs are provided by the browser. In this case, the WebAPIs are
            replaced by C++ bindings and the thread pool.

        <div>
            - Once the code is code is compiled and ready to be executed, a <i>Global Execution Context</i> is created
            for the top level code. Top-level code here means any code that is not inside any function. <br>
            - For example, the <i>name</i> variable is a part of the top-level code. Hence it will be executed in the
            Global execution Context. Then we have two functions - one expression and one declaration. These functions
            will be declared so that they can be called later. The point is that - the code inside the function will be
            executed only when the function is called. <br>
            - An <i>Execution Context</i> is defined as an environment in which a piece of JS code is executed. The
            context stores all the necessary information that is required by a code to be executed - such as local
            variables or arguments passed to a function. <br>
            - In every JS project, there is <i>only</i> one global execution context and this global execution context
            is where the top level code executes.
            <div class="row">

            </div>
            - Now that we have a top-level execution context, we can begin execution of the code. For each function in
            the code, a <i>new</i> execution context is created that contains all the necessary information that that
            particular function requires to run. The same also goes for <i>methods</i> because they are just functions
            attached to objects. All these execution contexts together make up the call stack. Once all the functions
            have been executed, the JS Engine will wait for the callback function to arrive so that it can begin
            executing those.

            - What is inside an Execution Context:
            <li><b>Variable Environment</b>: This environment stores all the variables and the function declarations.
                Apart
                from this, it also stores a special object called the <code>arguments</code> object. This object
                contains all the arguments that were passed into the function that the current Execution Context belongs
                to. Remember that each function gets its own execution context as soon as the function is called.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Scope Chain</b>: Apart from the local variables defined inside the function, the Execution Context
                can also
                access variables that are defined outside the function. The scope chain consists of <i>references</i> to
                variables that are outside the current function.
            </li>
            <li><code>this</code> <b>keyword</b> : One important sidenote is that Execution Contexts belonging to the
                arrow
                functions do not get their own <code>this</code> keyword or <code>arguments</code> object. Instead, they
                use the <code>this</code> and <code>arguments</code> of their nearest normal function parent.
            </li>

            on Udemy Lecture</a>. <br>
            - Recall, as we discussed earlier, the Call Stack with the Memory Heap forms the JS Engine. The Call Stack
            is the place where the Execution Contexts get stacked on top of each other to keep track of where we are in
            the execution. The Execution Context on the top of the stack is the one that is currently running. <a

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 92: Scope and the Scope Chain</div>
        <div>
            - <i>Scope</i> controls where you can access a particular variable and where you can't access them. <br>
            - JS uses <i>Lexical Scoping</i>, which means that scoping is controlled by the physical placement of
            functions and blocks in the code. <br>
            - In JS, we have 3 types of scope: <i>global</i> scope, <i>function</i> scope, and <i>block</i> scope. <br>
            - Note that only variables declared with <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> are restricted to the block
            in which they are created. That means that a variable that is declared using a <code>var</code> would be
            scoped to the parent function, or else the global scope. Hence, we say that <code>let</code> and
            <code>const</code> are <i>block scoped</i> whereas <code>var</code> is <code>function scoped</code>. IN ES5
            and earlier versions, we only had global scope and function scope.
            <div class="row">
                <img src="imgs/UdemyCourse/Module8/Scopes_In_JS.PNG"

            <br>
            - What is the Scope Chain? <br>
            - Each function creates it's own scope. Hence, <i>first()</i> and <i>second()</i> get their own scopes. <br>
            - Every scope has access to all of the variables from all of its outer/parent scopes. All of this also
            applies to function <code>arguments</code>. So this is basically how the Scope Chain works - if one scope
            needs to use a variable but is unable to find it in the current scope, it will look up it's scope chain and
            see if it can find the variable in one of it's parent scopes. If it can, then it will use that variable. If
            it can't, then you get an error. This process is also called <i>variable lookup in scope chain</i>. Note
            that a scope cannot look for variables in it's children scopes. <br>
            - Note that starting from ES6, the if-block is also able to create it's own scope. But this scope will only
            work for the ES6 variable types - <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.
            - Take note of the <i>millenial</i> variable in the below figure. The variable is declared with the <code>var</code>
            keyword. Hence, it is not scoped to the block, but rather scoped to the parent function, which in this case
            is <i>first()</i>. Hence, unlike the <i>decade</i> variable, we see the <i>millenial</i> variable in the
            scope of the <i>first()</i> function.

            <br>
            - What is the difference between the Scope Chain and the Call Stack? <br>
            - The scope of a function is the same as the Variable Environment in the function's Execution Context. Apart
            from this, the scope also inherits the scope from all of it's parent scopes because of the scope chain that
            we discussed above. <br>
            - The order of function calls has no effect on the scope chain. What I mean by this is, consider the
            following:

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 94: Variable Environment - Hoisting and the TDZ</div>
        <div>
            - Hoisting: makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared.
            In other words, variables are "lifted" to the top of their scope. Behind the scenes, what actually happens
            is that, before execution, the code is scanned for variable declarations and for each variable a new
            property is created in the <i>variable environment object</i><br>
            - The practical implementations of hoisting is that you can use a variable in the code <i>BEFORE</i> it is
            actually declared! The value associated with the hoisted variables also varies - refer the table below. <br>

            <div class="row">
                <img src="imgs/UdemyCourse/Module8/Hoisting_In_JS.PNG"
                     width="100%"

            - function declarations are hoisted - this means that these types of functions can be used/called before
            they are declared. <br>
            - Variables declared with <code>var</code> are also hoisted, but the hoisting works differently when
            compared to functions in the sense that the variables are hoisted, but their value is <code>undefined</code>
            and not the value that they are declared with. <br>
            - <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> variables are not hoisted. Hence these variables cannot be used
            before they are declared. TDZ stands for the Temporal Dead Zone, which is indicating the region in the code
            where the variable is in-scope but cannot be used because it has not been declared yet. <br>
            - For function expressions and arrow functions, the hoisting depends on whether they were created using
            <code>var</code>, <code>const</code>, or <code>let</code>. What this means is that function expressions and
            arrow functions declared with a <code>var</code> is hoisted, but to <code>undefined</code>. But if they have
            been declared using <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, the functions are not usable before they have
            been declared in the code - because of the TDZ. <br>
            - There is one another difference between variables declared with a <code>var</code> and <code>let</code>/
            <code>const</code> - the variables declared with <code>var</code> are added as properties to the global
            <code>window</code> object in JS, whereas the variables declared with <code>let</code>/<code>const</code>
            are not.

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 96: The <code>this</code> keyword</div>
        <div>
            - The <code>this</code> keyword is a special variable that is created for every Execution Context (i.e. for
            each function). We saw earlier that the <code>this</code> keyword is one of the three things that are a part
            of the Execution Context that is created for every function. In general terms, the <code>this</code> keyword
            takes the value of the "owner" of the function in which the <code>this</code> keyword is used. <br>
            - The value of <code>this</code> is not static and varies depending on the way that the function is called.
            <br>
            - A function can be called in multiple ways. <br>
            - A function can be a method - i.e. a function that is present on a object. When we use the
            <code>this</code> keyword in a method, the <code>this</code> keyword points to the object calling the
            method.
            <br>
            - A function can be called separately - like a usual stand-alone function call. In that case, the
            <code>this</code> keyword is <code>undefined</code>. But this is only in the case when we are using the
            "strict" mode. If we are not using the strict mode, tehn in that case the <code>this</code> keyword is going
            to point at the global object, which in this case is the <code>window</code> object. <br>
            - Arrow functions are not a way to call functions but they still need to be considered. Arrow functions do
            not get their own <code>this</code> keyword. Instead, if you use the <code>this</code> keyword in an arrow
            function, it is just going to be the <code>this</code> keyword of the surrounding/parent function. <br>
            - If the function is called as an event listener, then the <code>this</code> keyword will point to the DOM
            Element that the handler function is attached to.

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 98: Regular Functions vs Arrow Functions</div>
        <div>
            - One important point is that arrow functions should never be used as methods on an object. You should
            always use function expressions. This is to do with the fact that arrow functions do not get their own
            <code>this</code> keyword, instead they inherit the <code>this</code> keyword from their parent scope. This
            can be a source of bugs.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b120065c26c5f385cb358511a96c452f.js"></script>
            </div>
            - Another important point is when we have to use functions inside methods. <br>
            - Consider the following function inside a method. Why does line 11 print undefined? If you look closely,
            you can see that the <i>isMillennial</i> function is being called as a simple function call. So, even though
            the function is within a method, it is still a regular function call. And the rule says that inside a normal
            function call, the <code>this</code> keyword is <code>undefined</code>.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/cf44fdeb08397867de8fca65158cd325.js"></script>
            </div>

            - One way to get around this problem in solutions prior to ES6 was as follows:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/2c0586d4b5a32d6eddf2d7b8ecc6f561.js"></script>
            </div>

            - However, starting form ES6, we can use the arrow function to get around this problem. Recall that the
            arrow function does not have the <code>this</code> keyword of its own and instead inherits the
            <code>this</code> keyword of its parent scope. So, we can do this: <br>
            - TODO: but we are still calling the <i>isMillennial()</i> functio as a normal function inside the
            <i>gina3</i> object. Then shouldn't the <code>this</code> keyword be <code>undefined</code>?
            <div class="code-snippet">

            </div>

            - Another thing is the <code>arguments</code> variable that we discussed earlier:
            <div class="code-snippet">

            - The AND operator (<code>&&</code>) will return the <i>first</i> 'falsy' value among all of it's operands

            - An object literal is when you create a new object by using the <code>{}</code> operator. ES6 introduced 3
            new ways in which we can make writing object literals easier.

            the operator exists or not. By 'exists' we mean the nullish concept and not the truthy/false concept. A
            value is nullish only if it is either <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>. If the variable preceding
            the operator is nullish, then the execution of the statement will immediately return with the value of
            <code>undefined</code>. Else, the execution will proceed as normal.

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 115: Sets</div>
        <div>
            - In ES6, two new datastructures were added to JS - Sets and Maps. <br>
            - A set is a collection of unique values - there can be no duplicate elements in a set. Hence, sets are
            often used to remove duplicate elements from an array. <br>
            - A set can hold mixed datatypes. <br>
            - In the args for the constructor of the set, we can pass in any kind of iterable. Since an array is an
            iterable, it works. Similarly, if you pass in a single string, that would work as well. The resulting set
            that would be created would contain the unique characters that are present in the string.
            <div class="code-snippet">

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 116: Maps</div>
        <div>
            - Just like an object, the data in a map is stored as key-value pairs. The difference between the two is
            that in the case of maps, the keys can have <i>any</i> type, whereas in the case of objects, the keys <i>have
            to </i> be strings. So maps can have an object, an array, or even another map as a key. <br>
            - Note that the insertion order is maintained in maps in JS as mentioned <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50862944/8742428">here on SO</a>.

            at once by passing in an array as shown in the example below. This allows us to easily create maps from
            existing objects.<br>
            - Similarly, we can use existing maps to convert them into arrays by using the spread operator. <br>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 128: First-Class and Higher-Order Functions</div>
        <div>
            - JS has First-Class functions that enables us to write Higher-Order functions. But what does this mean?
            <br>
            - What does JS having 'First-Class Functions' mean? <br>
            - It just means that functions are a different 'type' of
            object in JS. Since objects are values, functions are values too. And since functions are values, they can
            be stored in variables or even object properties (keys in an object). We have already been doing this so
            far. <br>
            - We can also pass functions as args to other functions. We already did that with
            <code>addEvenListener</code> where we passed in the callback function as an argument . <br>
            - We can also return a function from another function. <br>
            - Finally, since functions are objects, and objects can have methods on them, there can also be function
            methods. <code>bind</code> method is an example of that. <br> <br>
            - What is a Higher-Order Function then? <br>
            - A Higher-Order function is either a function that receives a function as an argument, or returns a new
            function, or both. <br>
            - <code>addEventListener</code> is an example of a higher-order function because it accepts another function
            as an arg. <br>
            - Similarly we can have functions that return other functions.

        <div>
            - Just like the <code>call</code> and the <code>apply</code> method, the <code>bind</code> method allows us
            to set the <code>this</code> keyword for any function call. <br>
            - The difference is that, unlike the <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> methods, <code>bind</code>
            does not immediately call the function. Instead it returns a NEW function where the <code>this</code>
            keyword is already bound. <br>
            - This is especially useful when we have to manually assign the <code>this</code>
            keyword in the case of event listeners. Recall for event listeners the callback function should be a
            function, and it should not be immediately called. <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> immediately call
            the function. Hence we use the <code>bind</code> method instead.<br>

                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#closure">on MDN here</a>. <br>
            - A <i>closure</i> is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function
            was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure
            was created. <br>
            - Any function always has access to the variable environment of the execution context in which the function
            was created, even after that execution context is gone.

            - And now if look into the console, you will see something like this. Note that when the name of a property
            is enclosed in <code>[[ ]]</code>, as shown below, it means that the property is an internal property that
            cannot be accessed by us through the code.

        <div>
            - The <code>map</code> method returns a new array. It does not mutate the original array. <br>
            - For every element in the original array, the callback function passed into the map method is executed on
            that element. The result is stored in a new array, and that array is returned as the result. <br>
            - A rule of thumb is that the <code>forEach</code> method is used in case you want to produce side-effects.
            Use the <code>map</code> method when you want to follow a functional paradigm where you return a new array
            and do nto mutate the state of any existing objects.

            - Just like the <code>map</code> method, the <code>filter</code> method also accepts a callback function,

            - The callback function that is passed into the <code>reduce</code> method is different compared to the ones
            passed nto <code>map</code> or <code>forEach</code>. In the callback for the <code>reduce</code> method, the
            first parameter is the <i>accumulator</i>. This accumulator stores the value that will be finally returned
            from the <code>reduce</code> function. So, for example, if we are using the <code>reduce</code> method to
            calculate the sum of all the elements in an array, then the <i>accumulator</i> would simply return the final
            sum. <br>
            - The <code>reduce</code> method also accepts a second argument which t=is the starting value of the <i>accumulator</i>.

        <div>
            - The <code>find</code> method returns the <i>element</i> based on the condition that is specified in the
            callback function. Note that if multiple elements of the array satisfy the given condition, then in that
            case the <code>find</code> method will return the <i>first</i> element that satisfies the condition.

        <div>
            - <code>flat</code> Returns a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to
            the specified depth. <br>
            - <code>flatMap</code> Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array. Then, flattens the
            result into a new array. This is identical to a <code>map</code> followed by <code>flat</code> with depth 1.
            The <code>flatMap</code> method calls the callback function one time for each element in the array.

            - Note that the <code>sort</code> method by default converts everything to strings implicitly. Hence using

            a custom comparator when sorting numbers.
