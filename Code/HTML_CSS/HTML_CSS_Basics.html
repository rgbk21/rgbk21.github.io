        <div>
            - CSS can be used in the following ways: <br>
            <img src="imgs/Udemy_Lecture_HTML_CSS/Module3/Wasy_To_Use_CSS.PNG"
                 width="50%"
                 class="center-block img-fluid"
                 alt="Different ways to use CSS in page">
            - CSS is attached to the html page by pasting this into the head:
            <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="HTML_CSS_Basics.css"&gt;</code>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 12: Starting to make our web page pretty</div>
        <div>
            - Avoid repeating the same styles - meaning - group common property names in a single selector separated by
            commas

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/ed6542f7913cf873e053ab92446fe113.js"></script>
            </div>
            - Properties are inherited in CSS. When a property is declared on an element, all of the elements that are
            inside that element inherit that property. In other words, child elements inherit the properties of their
            parent elements. But remember that this behavior varies from property to property.
            Not all properties are inherited. <br>
            - Also we can override the styles of the parent element by defining a new style with the same name in the
            child element.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/d06929924737be25b4af5c7ed6120f33.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 13: Colors</div>
        <div>
            - Colors are represented in CSS using the RGB Model. <br>
            - Colors are represented using <code>#000000</code>. The
            first two 00 stand for the Red Channel, next two 00 for the green channel, and last two 00 for the blue
            channel. All colors are a combination of these three channels. <br>
            - If all the six letters in the hex code are the same, for eg. <code>#555555</code>, we can write it in
            shorthand as <code>#555</code>. <br>
            - In addition to this, colors in CSS can also have transparencies. If we want to include the transparency
            value, then we cannot use the hex notation to represent colors. Instead we use
            <code>rgba(29, 167, 23, 0.75)</code>. 0.75 is the transparency value. A value of 0 means the color is
            transparent, and a value of 1 means the color is completely solid.

        <div>
            - We prefer classes over id's in html because id's can be used only once in the entire page.
            <div class="code-snippet">

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 15: The CSS Box Model</div>
        <div>
            - The <i>content</i> is where the text and images appear. <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and
            <code>border</code> are properties in CSS and can specified either for the entire box, or for the individual
            sides - <i>top</i>, <i>right</i>, <i>bottom</i>, <i>left</i>. <br>
            - The box model also allows us to set the height and width of an element. The annoying thing about the
            standard box model is that you can set the height and the width only of the <i>content</i>, not of the
            entire box itself. What this means is that the <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and
            <code>border</code> are added to the height and width that we specify. This is not ideal.

                 width="50%"
                 class="center-block img-fluid"
                 alt="CSS Box Model">
            - In order to get around this, we use a CSS property called <code>box-sizing</code> and set it to
            <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code>.
            <img src="imgs/Udemy_Lecture_HTML_CSS/Module3/CSS_Box_Model_Border_Box.PNG"
                 width="50%"

                 alt="CSS Box Model after setting the box-sizing property">
            - In HTML, there are <i>block elements</i> and <i>inline elements</i>. Block elements use the entire width
            of the browser and force line breaks. Eg. heading, paragraph elements. Inline elements do not do anything of
            this sort. <a href="https://www.samanthaming.com/pictorials/css-inline-vs-inlineblock-vs-block/#a-inline">Inline
            elements do NOT start on a new line</a> and only takes up as much width as its content. So, if
            you try to set any width and height, it will have NO effects. <code>span</code>, <code>img</code>,
            <code>a</code> tags are some examples of inline elements. <br>
            - If you do not specify any margins in your stylesheet, all browsers, by default, add some margins to your
            elements. You can override these margins by using the universal selector <code>*</code>.

        <div>
            - Project page linked <a href="test.html">here</a>. <br>
            - This is the expected final setup of the page that we want:
            <img src="imgs/Udemy_Lecture_HTML_CSS/Module3/Expected_Output.PNG"
                 width="50%"
                 class="center-block img-fluid"
                 alt="Expected final setup of the page">
            - Go to the <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/learn/lecture/2569170?start=6">Udemy
            Lecture here</a>. <br>
            - Enclose the entire content of the page inside a div <code>my-container</code> <br>
            - Establish a width for <code>my-container</code> using <code>width: 1140px;</code> <br>
            - Center the <code>my-container</code> by using <code>margin-left: auto;</code> and
            <code>margin-right: auto;</code> properties. <br>
            - Divide the <code>my-container</code> div into the three boxes by using <code>div</code>. Because div
            elements are block elements, the three divs will be placed one below another right now. <br>
            - The <i>blog-posts</i> should occupy 70% of the width of the container and the <i>linked-posts</i> should
            occupy the remaining 30%. <br>
            - To put the <i>linked-posts</i> to the right of <i>blog-posts</i>, we need to use a new property called
            <code>float</code>. <code>float</code> allows us to push elements to the left or to the right, allowing
            other elements to wrap around it. So we put <code>float: left;</code> to both the <i>linked-posts</i> and
            the <i>blog-posts</i>. <br>
            - But now the <i>author-details</i> div also floats to the right. So we need a <i>clearfix</i> class to
            rectify this. Add the <i>clearfix</i> class to the CSS, and add a empty div before the <i>author-details</i>
            that uses the <i>clearfix</i> class. <br>
            - Add some padding to the right side of the <i>blog-posts</i> box using <code>padding-right: 30px;</code>.
            Remember that padding is within the box. Hence the background will remain colored in this case. Had you used
            margin, the background would have been white. <br>
            - Add some spacing from the top of the container using <code>margin-top</code>. <br>
            - Change the color of the hyper links only in the <i>author-details</i>. Use <code>.author-details a</code>
            selector to select only the anchor tags that are in the <i>author-details</i> class. <br>
            - If you were resizing images, make sure you change either only the <code>height</code> or only the <code>width</code>
            property so that the aspect ratio of the image is preserved. <br>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 18: Relative vs Absolute</div>
        <div>
            - We want to add a date to each post. The date should appear in the right top corner of the div. For this
            kind of stuff, we make use of the <code>position: absolute</code> and <code>position: relative</code>
            - The first thing that we need to make sure is that the parent element is a <code>relative</code> positioned
            element. In this case the parent of the <i>date</i> element is the <i>blog-post</i> element. Hence we need
            to edit the CSS of <i>blog-post</i> element to say <code>position: relative</code>. <br>
            - Then we change the CSS of the <i>date</i> element to say <code>position: absolute</code> and specify the
            exact location where we want the element to be placed. We need to explicitly say that the parent has
            position: relative, otherwise the browser would not know where to position the absolute element.<br>
            - The entire CSS so far looks like this:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/b3e40fece2837954be00f8a1210f0d29.js"></script>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 37: Setting up fluid grid for responsive web design</div>
        <div>
            - Following are the points to keep in mind to create responsive web design: <br>
            a) Fluid Grid: all layout elements are sized in relative units, such as percentages, instead of absolute A
            <code>header</code> element works like a normal <code>div</code>
            units, such as pixels. <br>
            b) Flexible images: are also sized in relative units <br>
            c) Media Queries: allow us to specify different CSS style rules for different browser widths. <br>
            - Add <code>grid.css</code> to the <code>vendors/css</code> folder. <br>
            - All of our data will be contained within rows. So we create a new class called <code>row</code> and assign
            it the following styles:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/fd3a73d161110cb7a544fa679288f63b.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 38: Building the header</div>
        <div>
            - A <code>header</code> element works like a normal <code>div</code> element. There are other similar
            elements like <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code> for the main body, and <code>footer</code>. Using these
            elements attaches semantics that are helpful for search engines. They know that this div is a header and not
            just another div with a random class applied to it. <br>
            - Add a background image to the div using <code>background-image: url("imgs/hero.jpg");</code>. <br>
            - But now you
            see a problem. The background image only fills the part of the header that has some content. We want the
            image to fill the entire viewport instead. We do that using <code>height: 100vh</code>. <br>
            - The image is too zoomed in right now. We want the image to fill the view:
            <code>background-size: cover;</code> <br>
            - When we resize the window now, the image cuts off. We want the aspect ratio of the image to changne on
            window resize such that the entire image is visible irrespective of the window size:
            <code>background-position: center;</code> <br>
            - Now we want to center the <code>div</code> both horizontally and vertically. We will have to use the
            <code>absolute</code> positioning in this case. In order to center the div, we first
            <code>position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%;</code>. But this means that the <i>starting</i> point of the
            div is now position center. We now need to offset it such that the div is centered:
            <code>transform: translate(-50%, -50%);</code>. This will translate the element half of it's width to the
            left, and half of it's height to the top. <br>
            - The next thing is we need to make the background image darker so that we can see the text that is present
            on the top of it. We do this by adding a image on top of the existing background image:
            <code>background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.7), rgba(0,0,0,0.7)), url("imgs/hero.jpg");</code> <br>
            - Next we want to change the font-size of the header element. But we do not want to specify the font-size in
            pixels. We have specified the base font-size in our html element as 20px. Relative to that, we do this in
            the h1 element: <code>font-size: 200%</code>. When we increase the font-size, we try to decrease the
            font-weight. We also want to change the heading to uppercase: <code>text-transform: uppercase;</code> <br>
            - We can increase the letter-spacing and the word-spacing as well.
            <code>letter-spacing: 1px; word-spacing: 4px;</code> <br>
            - We want to create button for the links. <br>
            - A button is by default an inline elements. We can change that to be a inline-block element. An
            inline-block element is a hybrid between a block and an inline element. An inline-block element does not
            force a line break, but you can add properties on it like padding and margin, unlike a normal inline
            element. We can change this by doing <code>display: inline-block;</code>. And now we can add some padding
            and margin to this element. <code>a</code> tags also have an underline by default. We can remove this by
            doing <code>text-decoration: none;</code> <br>
            - Right now the button is square. We can make the edges round: <code>border-radius: 200px;</code> <br>
            - Add a border to the button: <code>border: 1px solid #e67e22;</code>. <br>
            - Buttons can have 4 different states: <br>
            a) link: how the link looks like in the normal state <br>
            b) visited: how the link looks like after it has been visited (some links appear grey after having being
            clicked) <br>
            c) hover: when we put our mouse over the button <br>
            d) active: when we click on the button <br>
            - We want the behavior of the buttons in the normal state and after being visited to remain the same. Hence,
            we write the following. We are doing this by soecifying the same styles for
            <code>.btn:link, .btn:visited</code>. <code>link</code> and <code>visited</code> are examples of pseudo
            classes.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/673bffb28a7e5c6ab2c99e8ee51d99e0.js"></script>
            </div>
            - When we hover over or click a button, we want the behavior to be a bit different. We want the background
            to get a bit darker. Hence we can do this:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/6df51e2507ba5414d7f9f57b8b3ba7f3.js"></script>
            </div>
            - The transition of the background color from the lighter shade to the darker shade on hover is
            instantaneous. We want there to be a slight delay. To give the impression of an animation. We write:
            <code>transition: background-color 0.2s;</code>. We mean that when there is a transition in the
            <code>background-color</code> property, there should be a delay of 0.2s. But remember it's not just the
            <code>background-color</code> that we are changing. We are also changing the
            <code>border</code> and <code>color</code> as well. We can apply a single transition for all of them:
            <code>transition: background-color 0.5s, color 0.5s, border 0.5s;</code>. <br>
            - Now we want to add the <code>nav</code> element. The logo of the page is intended to go here. <br>
            - The nav links are present in the <code>nav</code> element as an <code>ul</code>. Test within the
            <code>ul</code> assigned bullets by default. We can override this default behavior by using:
            <code>list-style: none;</code>. <br>
            - <code>li</code> elements are block elements by default. Hence each of them introduce a line break. We want
            all the <code>li</code> elements to appear in a single line. Hence we change the <code>li</code> elements to
            <code>display: inline-block;</code>. <br>
            - Below each of the <code>li</code> elements in the <code>nav</code>bar, we want the element to be
            underlined once we hover over that element. But note that just defining this is not going to work properly:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/fb3a62ff816b30a685071d9f40fd296f.js"></script>
            </div>
            - What we need to do is define a transparent border on the <code>link/visited</code> itself. So the correct
            code should look like this:

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/da18e6eb2586a0607a77e03b7f19c86f.js"></script>
            </div>

            - Complete CSS at the end of this looks like this:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/75545185b2abf76375e65ad18d4ccb7f.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 41: Building the features section</div>
        <div>
            - Each page should have only one main <code>h1</code> heading. If you need more headings, use
            <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, and so on. <br>
            - <code>&amp;mdash;</code> gives us a bigger &mdash; compared to -. <br>
            - <code>text-align: center;</code> aligns the text to the center of the <code>div</code>. <br>
            - We can also add content to the webpage using JUST CSS. We do this by using the <code>:after</code> pseudo
            class. In this case, we want the element to appear after the <code>h2</code> heading element. In this
            particular case, we do not want to add text. We just want to add a small horizontal line that acts as a
            separator. Hence we write the following CSS:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/05676420185b1657b88108c5fadd6be1.js"></script>
            </div>
            - You should never change the styles of the classes that are being imported from other libraries, i.e.
            override the styles present in vendor css files. Always add your own class. For eg:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/7849a18978e5ce1d3898d96881a464c5.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 43: Building the favorite meals section</div>
        <div>
            - In this lecture we are going to build a grid of images that span the entire width of the screen. The
            images will be dark at first, but when you hover over them, the images will get lighter and their size will
            increase. <br>
            - For the images, we want a total of 8 images, 4 in each row with each row spanning the entire width of the
            screen. The way to implement this is to have each image as an <code>li</code> item in <code>ul</code>. Hence
            2 <code>ul</code>s, with each <code>ul</code> having 4 <code>li</code> items. Each <code>li</code> in turn
            is going to contain one image. Remember that <code>li</code> items can contain anything - text, images, etc.
            <br>
            - Let's start applying the relevant CSS now. <br>
            - Remove the default bullets from the ul elements: <code>list-style: none;</code> <br>
            - Have the ul occupy the entire width of the webpage: <code>width: 100%;</code> <br>
            - Start styling the li elements within the ul <br>
            - Each image should display as a block: <code>display: block;</code> <br>
            - Instead of each image occurring one below the other, we want the images to be next to each other:
            <code>float: left;</code> <br>
            - We have 4 images to display within a width of 100%. Hence for each image: <code>width: 25%;</code> <br>
            - Take note of how the widths of the elements are stacked. The <code>ul</code> element takes the entire
            available width of the webpage. Each <code>li</code> element within the <code>ul</code> takes a width of
            25% of it's parent container - the parent in this case being <code>ul</code>. Hence width of each
            <code>li</code> is also computed as 25%. Each <code>img</code> within the <code>li</code> takes a width of
            100% of it's parent container - the parent container in this case being the <code>li</code>. Hence the image
            still occupies only 25% of the screen width. Even after you resize the screen, you can see the entire image
            being visible. <br>

            <img src="imgs/Udemy_Lecture_HTML_CSS/Module5/Image_Widths.PNG"
                 width="100%"
                 class="center-block img-fluid"
                 alt="Image widths">


            - We are increasing the size of the image. We want the image to be 115%:
            <code>transform: scale(1.15);</code>. You can see in the browser that this means the images will no longer
            fir in the width of the browser and we now see the horizontal scrollbar appear to accommodate the images.
            <br>
            - The reason this happens is that the images are 'overflowing' from their parent container, which as you can
            see in the html, is the <code>meals-showcase</code> class. Hence we need to tell CSS to hide any overflow,
            which we do by adding <code>overflow: hidden;</code> to the <code>meals-showcase</code> class. <br>
            - Next, when we hover over the image, we want the image to return back to it's original size:
            <code>transform: scale(1.05);</code>. Scaling to 1.05 instead of 1 because scaling to 1 causes a white gap
            to appear between the images. <br>
            - Next we want to do is animate this transformation in size on hover
            <code>transition: transform 0.5s;</code> <br>
            - The next effect that we want to create is we want all of the images to be darker initially. Then when we
            hover over the image that we want, that image becomes darker. All the images in the
            <code>meals-showcase</code>can be made darker by following these two steps: <br>
            a) Change the opacity of the <code>meals-showcase</code> container to 0.7 (important that you change the
            opacity here. Else you get weird overlap errors). But now the image becomes lighter, and this is because the
            background of the image is white. Hence the next step is to make the background color of the image container
            as black. <br>

            b) The <code>meals-showcase</code> has the opacity set to 0.7. Hence we change the background-color of it's
            parent color to black. <br>

            - The last thing we want to do is, on hover, change the opacity back to 1 with some animation.

            - How do we add a clickable image that serves as a button:
            <code>&lt;a href="link-you-want-to-go-to"&gt;&lt;img src="your-image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> <br>
            - We have two useful pseudo selectors:
            <code>.steps-box:first-child</code> and <code>.steps-box:last-child</code>. These will select the first and
            the last elements which have the <code>steps-box</code> class applied to it. <br>
            - <code>text-align</code> does not only align the text, but any inline image within the box is also aligned.
            Images are inline element. Hence, <code>text-align</code> can be used to align images within the box as
            well. <br>
            - We want to add numbers to the steps - numbers 1, 2, 3 and circle them. Go through the CSS for this. <br>
            - Format the buttons to to have the same size <br>
            - Another pseudo-selector is <code>last-of-type</code>. <a

            - When you define some floats, you also have to clear thos flows. This is where we normally use the <code>clearfix</code>
            hack that we talked about earlier. You can check whether you require the <code>clearfix</code> by looking at
            the height of the floated element. If the height is 0, it means that you will have to clear the flow. <br>

            - Main takeaway was how are we going to align icons with text. Refer
            the lecture <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/learn/lecture/2619792?start=180#notes">here</a>
            if you want to see how the icons are supposed to look like in the page. <br>
            - If you want to align the icons, you do the following:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/6f531ee0f30f2225d84225629739eb76.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 49: Building the Customer Testimonials Section</div>
        <div>
            - We want to include testimonials from our customers, which is basically comments provided by our customers
            on our services. HTML has a <code>blockquote</code> element that indicates that the enclosed text is an
            extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. <br>
            - Add a background image to the testimonials section:
            <code>background-image: url("imgs/back-customers.jpg");</code> <br>
            - Have the image fill the entire background:
            <code>background-size: cover;</code> <br>
            - Make the background image darker by overlaying a dark gradient on top of the image <br>
            <code>background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.8), rgba(0,0,0,0.8)),</code>
            <code>url("imgs/back-customers.jpg");</code> <br>
            - Make the text white: <code>color: #ffffff;</code> <br>
            - Make the background image static so that when the page is scrolled, the position of the image remains
            fixed: <code>background-attachment: fixed;</code> <br>
            - Whenever you want to include italic text in your webpage, you have to make sure that you have included
            italic fonts as well in your page, like you have done in the header element of this page. <br>
            - The <code>vertical-align</code> CSS property sets vertical alignment of an inline, inline-block or
            table-cell box. Set <code>vertical-align: middle;</code> for the name of the person to appear vertically
            center aligned to the image. <br>
            - We want to add a quotation mark before the text of the testimonial starts. Recall that content can be
            added to the webpage just through CSS only. We will define the position of the blockquote as
            <code>absolute</code>. Recall that for an element to be positioned as <code>absolute</code>, we need the
            parent element to be positioned as <code>relative</code> or else the changes are not going to take effect.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Lecture 51: Building the Sign-Up Section</div>
        <div>
            - We use the <code>span</code> element in order to style some text in a <code>p</code>, or some other
            enclosing element, in a way that is different from the styling that has eben applied to the parent element.
            <br>
            - Remember that certain CSS properties are inherited. For example, consider the following CSS for a <code>span</code>
            element that is within the <code>plan-price</code> class.
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/68c16e73dfa78c7dd6efdfa3942ab79c.js"></script>
            </div>
            - There is a special character that you can add for space in HTML: <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>.
