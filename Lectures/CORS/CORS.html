    <div class="textual-content">

        <div class="sub-heading">What is CORS</div>
        <div>
            - In CORS, the server-side component configures which types of cross-origin requests are allowed and the client-side component controls how cross-origin requests are
            made. <br>
            - Browsers have a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#definition_of_an_origin">same-origin policy</a>, which means that a
            browser can only make requests to servers that have the same <i>origin</i>. CORS allows us to side-step this
            requirement by allowing cross-origin requests. This might seem antithetical, but the reasoning is that CORS puts the servers firmly in charge of who can make requests
            and what types of requests are allowed. This gives servers the choice to open up its API to all clients, open it up to a small number of clients, or prevent access to
            all clients. <br>
            - On a higher level, this is how the flow of CORS proceeds: <br>
            a) The CORS request is initiated by the JavaScript client code <br>
            b) The browser includes additional HTTP headers on the request before sending the request to the server <br>
            c) The server includes HTTP headers in the response that indicate whether the request is allowed <br>
            d) If the request is allowed, the browser sends the response to the client code <br>
            - If the headers returned by the server don't exist or aren't what the browser expects then the response is rejected and the client can't view the response.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Sending a CORS Request</div>
        <div>
            - Before we send a CORS request, we need to make sure that the browser actually supports a CORS request. This can be validated by checking the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials"><code>XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials</code></a> property of the XHR object.
            <br>
            - The <code>XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials</code> property is a Boolean that indicates whether or not cross-site Access-Control requests should be made using
            credentials such as cookies, authorization headers or TLS client certificates. Setting <code>withCredentials</code> has no effect on same-site requests. <br>
            - In addition, this flag is also used to indicate when cookies are to be ignored in the response. The default is false. <br>
            - Note: <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> from a different domain cannot set cookie values for their own domain unless <code>withCredentials</code> is set to true before
            making the request regardless of Access-Control- header values. The third-party cookies obtained by setting <code>withCredentials</code> to true
            will still honor same-origin policy and hence can not be accessed by the requesting script through <code>document.cookie</code> or from response headers. <br>
            <img src="images/Ch1/HTTP_Request_Respone_Headers.png"
                 width="1200"
                 class="center-block img-fluid"
                 alt="Request_Response_CORS">
            - Note that in your Spring Code Controller setup, you cannot use <code> * </code> for <code>origins</code>, meaning this is an invalid use of the annotation:
            <code>@CrossOrigin(origins = "*", allowedHeaders = "*", allowCredentials = "true")</code> which produces the following error when you try to compile the Spring Code:
            java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: When allowCredentials is true, allowedOrigins cannot contain the special value "*" since that cannot be set on the
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" response header. To allow credentials to a set of origins, list them explicitly or consider using "allowedOriginPatterns" instead. <br>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">Why use CORS</div>
        <div>
            - CORS gives servers the flexibility to configure cross-origin access in a variety of ways. The server can specify various features: <br>
            a) Which domains are allowed to make requests <br>
            b) Which HTTP methods are allowed to make requests (eg. <code>GET/PUT/POST/DELETE</code>) <br>
            c) Which headers are allowed on the HTTP request <br>
            d) Whether or not requests may include cookie data <br>
            e) Which response headers the client can read
        </div>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <div id="Chapter2" class="chapter">Chapter 2: Making CORS Requests</div>
    <hr>

    <div class="textual-content">
        - A CORS request consists of two sides: the client making the request and the server receiving the request. On the client side, the developer writes the JS code to send the
        request to the server. The server responds to the request by setting CORS-specific headers to indicate that the cross-origin request is allowed. Without both the client's
        and the server's participation, the CORS request will fail.

        <div class="sub-heading">How to process a cross-origin request</div>
        <div>
            - There are 3 parts to making a HTTP request: <br>
            a) <p class="inline-heading">Set up the request parameters</p>: <br>
            - It starts by defining the HTTP method to use and the URL to which the request has to be sent to. In case of a cross-origin request, the full URL of the resource needs
            to be specified. There is no other special information required to delineate the request as a cross-origin request. The browser does the work of parsing the URL and
            determining if the request is a same-origin or a cross-origin request. <br>
            - If the browser supports CORS, then it's <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is going to have a field named: <code>withCredentials</code>. You can check this on the browser by
            running <code>let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.withCredentials</code>. This should not print <code>undefined</code>. Ideally, it should be <code>false</code>, as
            specified in the documentation on MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials">here</a>. If you were going to make a
            CORS request, you would have to set it to <code>true</code> before sending the request. <br>
            - The <code>setRequestHeader</code> method lets you add HTTP headers to the request. This method includes the header request and the header value, and includes the
            header on the request. For example, this is how you would add a header named <i>X-Requested-With</i> to the request:
            <code>xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Requested-With', 'CORS In Action)</code> <br>
            - <p class="inline-heading">NOTE</p>: there are some headers that are set by the browser, that can't be set by the user. The browser sets a header named <i>Origin</i>
            on the cross-origin requests.
            If you try to override this header in your code, the browser will ignore your value. This is a security measure that helps prevent the user code from overriding trusted
            header values. The server can trust these values because it knows that the user hasn't accidentally (or maliciously) tainted the values of these headers. (If you could
            change the value of this header you could pretend to be from a domain that might not be allowed access to a certain API). <br>
            - There are several headers that cannot be set by a <code>setRequestHeader</code> method: Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Access-Control-Request-Headers,
            Access-ControlRequest-Method, Connection, Content-Length, Cookie, Cookie2, Date, DNT, Expect, Host, Keep-Alive, Origin, Referer, TE, Trailer, Transfer-Encoding,
            Upgrade, User-Agent, Via, and any headers starting with 'Proxy-' or 'Sec-'. These headers have special meaning and can only be set by the browser. There is no
            error if the code tries to set the header. The value is just ignored. <br>
            - <p class="inline-heading">NOTE</p>: The server has to give its permission for the client to include custom request headers in a cross-origin request. This behavior is
            unique to a cross-origin
            request. Same-origin requests can include any custom headers in the request. But for a cross-origin request, if the server doesn't whitelist the request headers, the
            request WILL fail. <br>
            - Even after the request has been sent, there are a couple of ways to cancel the request. You can either call the <code>abort</code> method which will cause the
            currently executing request to be immediately cancelled. Another option is to set the <code>timeout</code> value in the request. This specifies the number of
            milliseconds a request can take before being forced to terminate. The default value is 0, which means there is no timeout. The request will continue till the server
            responds. <br>
            - The XHR request that is sent is an asynchronous request by default. <br>
            - This is a sample jQuery request that we are using:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/2a18485409506d33ef2453d5901aa3ac.js"></script>
            </div>
            b) <p class="inline-heading">Send the request</p>: Nothing special to do here. When you call <code>$.ajax()</code>, it both initializes and sends the HTTP request. <br>
            c) <p class="inline-heading">Process the response</p>: The <code>getResponseHeader</code> and <code>getAllResponseHeaders</code> methods can be used to read the HTTP
            headers on the response.
            <code>getResponseHeader</code> returns the value of a given response header whereas <code>getAllResponseHeaders</code> returns all response headers as a single string.
            <br>
            - <p class="inline-heading">NOTE:</p>There is one caveat to reading response headers on a cross-origin request. By default, CORS only allows the client code to read the
            following response headers: Cache-Control, Content-Language, Content-Type, Expires, Last-Modified, Pragma <br>
            - If the <i>server</i> sets any additional response headers that are not in this list, the client won't be able to see them. But the server can also override this
            behavior by specifically indicating that these additional response headers should be visible to the client code. <br>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading">When will the <code>success</code> block be triggered vs when will the <code>error</code> block be triggered</div>
        <div>
            - HTTP responses have an associated status code. A successful response usually has a status code of 200, although any status code in the 200 range signals a success.
            Status codes in the 300 range signal that the request is being redirected, while status codes of 400 or above signal an error (the 400 range is reserved for client
            errors while the 500 range is reserved for server errors). <br>
            - Regardless of the underlying response status code, if the response makes it back to the browser, the onload event handler will fire. So although a request may fail
            due to a file not found (status code 404) or an internal server error (status code 500), the onload event handler will still fire. The below figure shows the
            relationship between the response and the response status code. <br>
            - If the request fails for some other reason, the onerror event handler will fire. These are errors where the server doesn't send a valid response to the browser, or
            the server doesn't support CORS.

                 width="750"
                 class="center-block img-fluid"
                 alt="Http Error Codes">
            - But note that in jQuery the errors are set up differently. Anything other than a 2XX response code causes the <code>error</code> block to be executed.

            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/e8e6f0a159cd113c7cd75ae7ea7e8916.js"></script>
            </div>
            - And the errors that are logged on the console and the Network tab are as follows:

                 width="1500"
                 class="center-block img-fluid"
                 alt="jQuery Error Codes">
        </div>

        <div class="sub-heading">How can I include cookies on cross-origin requests</div>
        <div>
            - Websites can identify users through user credentials, a general term for any bit of information that can identify a user. The most popular form of user credentials is
            the cookie. Servers will use cookies to store a unique ID that identifies the user. The browser then includes this cookie on every request to the server. <br>
            - <p class="inline-heading">NOTE</p>: Same-origin HTTP requests will always contain the cookie in the request. In contrast, cross-origin requests don't include cookies
            by default. <br>
            - Cookies can be included on cross-origin requests by setting the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>'s <code>withCredentials</code> property to true. Setting the <code>withCredentials</code>
            property to true indicates that user credentials such as cookies, basic authentication information, or clientside Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates should be
            included on cross-origin requests. <br>
            - However, just setting the <code>withCredentials</code> property to true is not enough to complete the request. The server also has to indicate that it allows cookies
            for the request to succeed.

        <div class="sub-heading">jQuery does not include the <code>X-Requested-With</code> header in the cross-origin requests</div>
        <div>
            - jQuery doesn't set the X-Requested-With request header on cross-origin requests. JQuery traditionally sets the X-Requested-With header on HTTP requests. <br>
            - This header is used by clients to indicate that a request is coming from an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object. The server receiving the request can look for the
            <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> header to determine where the request is coming from. JQuery always sets this header when making same-origin requests, but removes it from
            cross-origin requests. The reason is that setting custom request headers requires an additional server configuration step. Rather than force developers to make changes
            to their server, jQuery chose to drop this header. <br>
            - You can set this header manually in jQuery as follows:
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/rgbk21/8365c38ee1b25a7c3368da86b0b9a08d.js"></script>
            </div>
            - And you can see the header being sent in the request below. Note that on the server-side we are allowing ALL headers, and that is why we can see the new header here.
