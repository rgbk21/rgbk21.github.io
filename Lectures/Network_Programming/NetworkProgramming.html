    <div class="sub-heading">Network Protocol Suite</div>
    <div>
      - Modern networks are called packet switching networks because they transmit data in chunks called packets. Each packet is transmitted independent of other packets.
      This makes it easy to transmit the packets from the same computer to the same destination using different routes. However, it may become a problem if a computer sends
      two packets to a remote computer and the second packet arrives before the first one. For this reason, each packet also has a packet number along with its destination
      address. There are rules to rearrange the out-of-order arrival of the packets at the destination computer. <br>
      - The Internet Reference Model or the TCP/IP Layering Model is an example of a layered protocol suite.
      <div class="row">

      </div>
      - <i>Packet</i> is a generic term that is used to mean an independent chunk of data in network programming. Each layer of protocol also uses a specific term to mean the
      packet it deals with. For example, a packet is called a <i>segment</i> in the TCP layer; it is called a <i>datagram</i> in the IP layer; it is called a <i>frame</i> in
      the network interface and physical layers. Each layer adds a header (sometimes also a trailer) to the packet it receives from the layer before it, while preparing the
      packet to be transmitted over the network. Each layer performs the reverse action when it receives a packet from the layer below it. It removes the header from the
      packet; performs some actions, if needed; and hands over the packet to the layer above it. <br><br>
      <p class="inline-heading">Application Layer</p>: A user application such as a Java program uses the application layer to communicate to a remote application. The user
      application has to specify the protocol that it wants to use to communicate with the remote application. A protocol in an application layer defines the rules for
      formatting messages and associating the meaning to the information contained in the messages such as the message type, describing whether it is a request or a response,
      etc. After the application layer formats the message, it hands over the message to the transport layer. The examples of protocols in an application layer are Hypertext
      Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, Telecommunication Network (Telnet), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Network News Transfer
      Protocol (NNTP). <br><br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Transport Layer Protocol</p>: The transport layer protocol handles the ways messages are transported from one application on one computer to
      another application on the remote computer. It controls the data flow, error handling during data transmission, and connections between two applications. For example, a
      user application may hand over a very large chunk of data to the transport layer to transmit to a remote application. The remote computer may not be able to handle that
      large amount of data at once. It is the responsibility of the transport layer to pass a suitable amount of data at a time to the remote computer, so the remote
      application can handle the data according to its capacity. The data passed to the remote computer over a network may be lost on its way due to various reasons. It is
      the responsibility of the transport layer to retransmit the lost data. Note that the application layer passes data to be transmitted to the transport layer only once.
      It is the transport layer (not the application layer) that keeps track of the delivered and the lost data during a transmission. There may be multiple applications
      running, all of which use different protocols and exchange information with different remote applications. It is the responsibility of the transport layer to hand over
      messages sent to a remote application correctly. For example, you may be browsing the Internet using the HTTP protocol from one remote web server and downloading a file
      using the FTP protocol from another FTP server. Your computer is receiving messages from two remote computers and they are meant for two different applications running
      on your computer - one web browser to receive HTTP data and one FTP application to receive FTP data. It is the responsibility of the transport layer to pass the
      incoming data to the appropriate application. You can see how different layers of the protocol suite play different roles in data transmission over the network.
      Depending on the transport layer protocol being used, the transport layer adds relevant information to the message and passes it to the next layer, which is the
      internet layer. The examples of protocols used in the transport layer are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Stream Control
      Transmission Protocol (SCTP). <br><br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Internet Layer</p>: The internet layer accepts the messages from the transport layer and prepares a packet suitable for sending over the
      internet. It includes the Internet Protocol (IP). The packet prepared by the IP is also known as an IP datagram. It consists of a header and a data area, apart from
      other pieces of information. The header contains the sender’s IP address, destination IP address, time to live (TTL, which an integer), a header checksum, and many
      other pieces of information specified in the protocol. The IP prepares the message into datagrams, which are ready to be transmitted over the internet. The TTL in the
      IP datagram header specifies how long, in terms of the number of routers, an IP datagram can keep traveling before it needs to be discarded. Its size is one byte and
      its value could be between 1 and 255. When an IP datagram reaches a router in its route to the destination, the router decrements the TTL value by 1. If the decremented
      value is zero, the router discards the datagram and sends an error message back to the sender using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). If the TTL value is still
      a positive number, the router forwards the datagram to the next router. The IP uses an address scheme, which assigns a unique address to each computer. The address is
      called an IP address. The internet layer hands over the IP datagram to the next layer, which is the network interface layer. The examples of protocols in an internet
      layer are Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). <br><br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Network Interface Layer</p>: The network interface layer prepares a packet to be transmitted on the network. The packet is called a
      <i>frame</i>. The network interface layer sits just on top of the physical layer, which involves the hardware. Note that the IP layer uses the IP address to identify
      the destination on a network. An IP address is a virtual address, which is completely maintained in software. The hardware is unaware of the IP address and it does not
      know how to transmit a frame using an IP address. The hardware must be given the hardware address, also called <i>Media Access Control (MAC)</i> address, of the
      destination that it needs to transmit the frame to. This layer resolves the destination hardware address from the IP address and places it in the frame header. It hands
      over the frame to the physical layer. The examples of protocols in a network interface layer are Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP),
      Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). <br><br>

      <p class="inline-heading">Physical Layer</p>: The physical layer consists of the hardware. It is responsible for converting the bits of information into signals
      and transmitting the signal over the wire.
